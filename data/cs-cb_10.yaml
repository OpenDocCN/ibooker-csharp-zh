  zh: 概要
- en: In many ways, this book has been a reflection of my own career. In one form
    or another, each recipe represents solutions to problems that I and others have
    encountered over the years. However, it’s more than that because the thought process
    that goes into each recipe, chapter, and the entire book has been illuminating.
    The way we write code today has changed a lot. So have the types of applications
    we write.

  zh: 从很多方面来看，这本书反映了我自己的职业生涯。每一个配方或多或少都代表了多年来我和其他人在解决问题时的解决方案。然而，它不仅如此，因为每一个配方、章节乃至整本书背后的思维过程都是启发性的。我们今天编写代码的方式已经发生了很大变化。我们编写的应用程序类型也不同了。
- en: C# was born in an era of the internet coming of age, when the .com bust of the
    early 2000s was barely conceivable. The impetus behind its creation was the legal
    battles between Microsoft and Sun Microsystems over the Java programming language.
    Microsoft needed a component-based programming language for its new .NET platform.
    It was the early days of distributed computing, and visions of proprietary remoting
    technology and XML Web services have come and gone. Today is a different world.

  zh: C#语言诞生于互联网发展的时代，早期2000年代的互联网泡沫几乎是不可想象的。它的创立动机源于微软与Sun Microsystems之间关于Java编程语言的法律纠纷。微软需要一种面向组件的编程语言来支持新的.NET平台。当时正值分布式计算的初期阶段，专有远程技术和XML
    Web服务的愿景已经来去匆匆。如今是一个截然不同的世界。
- en: In the intervening years, we’ve seen revolutions that changed the entire face
    of computing. Mobile phones evolved into smart phones with more computing power
    than the original IBM PC. Applications and entire businesses moved from hosted
    services to the cloud. Client/server and nascent distributed computing models
    became massive world-scale native cloud applications using microservice architectures
    and serverless computing. The types of applications we build are different.

  zh: 在接下来的几年里，我们见证了彻底改变计算机界面貌的革命。移动电话演变为拥有比原始IBM PC更多计算能力的智能手机。应用程序和整个企业从托管服务转向云端。客户端/服务器和初期的分布式计算模型发展成为采用微服务架构和无服务器计算的大规模本地云应用程序。我们构建的应用程序类型也不同了。
- en: So, as the computing world has evolved, the programming languages and tools
    we use must embrace that change. That was the goal with this book, and I hope
    it helps you. I’m honored to have shared this journey with you and wish you the
    best in your C# development career.

  zh: 因此，随着计算世界的演变，我们使用的编程语言和工具必须接纳这种变化。这本书的目标就是如此，我希望它能帮助到你。能与你共享这段旅程我感到非常荣幸，祝愿你在C#开发职业生涯中一切顺利。
