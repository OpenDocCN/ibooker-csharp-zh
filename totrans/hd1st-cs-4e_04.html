<h1>Unity Lab #1: Explore C# with Unity</h1>&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Unity" data-secondary="power of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46402347965496"/>Welcome to your first <strong>Head First C# Unity Lab</strong>. Writing code is a skill, and like any other skill, getting better at it takes <strong>practice and experimentation</strong>. Unity will be a really valuable tool for that.</p>&#13;
<p>Unity is a cross-platform game development tool that you can use to make professional-quality games, simulations, and more. It’s also a fun and satisfying way to get <strong>practice with the C# tools and ideas</strong> you’ll learn throughout this book. We designed these short, targeted labs to <strong>reinforce</strong> the <u>concepts and techniques you just learned</u> to help you hone your C# skills.</p>&#13;
<p>These labs are optional, but valuable practice—<strong>even if you <u>aren’t</u> planning on using C# to build games</strong>.</p>&#13;
<p>In this first lab, you’ll get up and running with Unity. You’ll get oriented with the Unity editor, and you’ll start creating and manipulating 3D shapes.</p>&#13;

Unity includes many powerful things, including...</p>&#13;
<p><strong>A cross-platform game engine</strong></p>&#13;
<p>A <strong>game engine</strong> displays the graphics, keeps track of the 2D or 3D characters, detects when they hit each other, makes them act like real-world physical objects, and much, much more. Unity will do all of these things for the 3D games you build throughout this book.</p>&#13;

<p><strong>A powerful 2D and 3D scene editor</strong></p>&#13;
<p>You’ll be spending a lot of time in the Unity editor. It lets you edit levels full of 2D or 3D objects, with tools that you can use to design complete worlds for your games. Unity games use C# to define their behavior, and the Unity editor integrates with Visual Studio to give you a seamless game development environment.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">While these Unity Labs will concentrate on C# development in Unity, if you’re a visual artist or designer, the Unity editor has many artist-friendly tools designed just for you. Check them out here: <a href="https://unity3d.com/unity/features/editor/art-and-design">https://unity3d.com/unity/features/editor/art-and-design</a>.</span></p>&#13;

<p><strong>An ecosystem for game creation</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Beyond being an enormously powerful tool for creating games, Unity also features an ecosystem to help you build and learn. The Learn Unity page (<a href="https://unity.com/learn">https://unity.com/learn</a>) has valuable self-guided learning resources, and the Unity forums (<a href="https://forum.unity.com">https://forum.unity.com</a>) help you connect with other game designers and ask questions. The Unity Asset Store (<a href="https://assetstore.unity.com">https://assetstore.unity.com</a>) provides free and paid assets like characters, shapes, and effects that you can use in your Unity projects.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Our Unity Labs will focus on using Unity as a tool to explore C#, and practicing with the C# tools and ideas that you’ve learned throughout the book.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>The <em><code>Head First C#</code></em> Unity Labs are laser-focused on a <strong>developer-centric learning path</strong>. The goal of these labs is to help you ramp up on Unity quickly, with the same focus on brain-friendly just-in-time learning you’ll see throughout <em><code>Head First C#</code></em> to <strong><em>give you lots of targeted, effective practice with C# ideas and techniques</em></strong>.</p>&#13;

<p>Unity Hub lets you install multiple versions of Unity on the same computer, so you should install the same version that we used to build these labs. <strong>Click Official Releases</strong> and install the latest version that starts with <strong><em>Unity 2020.1</em></strong>—that’s the same version we used to take the screenshots in these labs. Once it’s installed, make sure that it’s set as the preferred version.</p>&#13;
<p>The Unity installer may prompt you to install a different version of Visual Studio. You can have multiple installations of Visual Studio on the same computer too, but if you already have one version of Visual Studio installed there’s no need to make the Unity installer add another one.</p>&#13;
<p>You can learn more about installing Unity Hub on Windows, macOS, and Linux here: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingHub.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingHub.html</a>.</p>&#13;

<h1>Make Visual Studio your Unity script editor</h1>&#13;
<p>The Unity editor works hand-in-hand with the Visual Studio IDE to make it really easy to edit and debug the code for your games. So the first thing we’ll do is make sure that Unity is hooked up to Visual Studio. <strong>Choose Preferences from the Edit menu</strong> (or from the Unity menu on a Mac) to open the Unity Preferences window. Click on External Tools on the left, and <strong>choose Visual Studio</strong> from the External Script Editor window.</p>&#13;
<p><em>In some older versions of Unity, you may see an <strong>Editor Attaching</strong> checkbox—if so, make sure that it’s checked (that will let you debug your Unity code in the IDE).</em></p>&#13;

<p><a data-primary="3D environments, Unity Hub scenes as" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46402347883224"/>As soon as you start the editor, you’re editing a <strong>scene</strong>. You can think of scenes as levels in your Unity games. Every game in Unity is made up of one or more scenes. Each scene contains a separate 3D environment, with its own set of lights, shapes, and other 3D objects. When you created your project, Unity added a scene called SampleScene, and stored it in a file called <em><code><strong>SampleScene.unity</strong></code></em>.</p>&#13;
<p>Add a sphere to your scene by choosing <strong>GameObject &gt;&gt; 3D Object &gt;&gt; Sphere</strong> from the menu:</p>&#13;

The GameObject is a fundamental concept in Unity. Every item, shape, character, light, camera, and special effect in your Unity game is a GameObject. Any scenery, characters, and props that you use in a game are represented by GameObjects.</p>&#13;
<p>In these Unity Labs, you’ll build games out different kinds of GameObjects, including:</p>&#13;

</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Each GameObject contains a number of <strong>components</strong> that provide its shape, set its position, and give it all of its behavior. For example:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li><p><em>Transform components</em> determine the position and rotation of the GameObject.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><em>Material components</em> change the way the GameObject is <strong>rendered</strong>—or how it’s drawn by Unity—by changing the color, reflection, smoothness, and more.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><em>Script components</em> use C# scripts to determine the GameObject’s behavior.</p></li>&#13;

Look through the Inspector window—you’ll see that your sphere has four components labeled Transform, Sphere (Mesh Filter), Mesh Renderer, and Sphere Collider.</p>&#13;
<p>Every GameObject has a set of components that provide the basic building blocks of its behavior, and every GameObject has a <strong>Transform component</strong> that drives its location, rotation, and scale.</p>&#13;
<p>You can see the Transform component in action as you use the Move Gizmo to drag the sphere around the X-Y plane. Watch the X and Y numbers in the Position row of the Transform component change as the sphere moves.</p>&#13;

<p><a data-primary="GameObjects" data-secondary="adding material to" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46402347817992"/>Unity uses <strong>materials</strong> to provide color, patterns, textures, and other visual effects. Your sphere looks pretty boring right now because it just has the default material, which causes the 3D object to be rendered in a plain, off-white color. Let’s make it look like a billiard ball.</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Select the sphere.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>When the sphere is selected, you can see its material as a component in the Inspector window:</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/096fig01.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>We’ll make your sphere more interesting by adding a <strong>texture</strong>—that’s just a simple image file that’s wrapped around a 3D shape, almost like you printed the picture on a rubber sheet and stretched it around your object.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Go to our Billiard Ball Textures page on GitHub.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/head-first-csharp/fourth-edition">https://github.com/head-first-csharp/fourth-edition</a> and click on the <em>Billiard Ball Textures</em> link to browse a folder of texture files for a complete set of billiard balls.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Download the texture for the 8 ball.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Click on the file <em>8 Ball Texture.png</em> to view the texture for an 8 ball. It’s an ordinary 1200 × 600 PNG image file that you can open in your favorite image viewer.</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;

<p>Download the file into a folder on your computer.</p>&#13;
<p><em>(You might need to right-click on the Download button to save the file, or click Download to open it and then save it, depending on your browser.)</em></p></li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Import the 8 Ball Texture image into your Unity project.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Right-click on the Assets folder in the Project window, choose <strong>Import New Asset...</strong> and import the texture file. You should now see it when you click on the Assets folder in the Project window.</p>&#13;

<li><p><strong>Add the texture to your sphere.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Now you just need to take that texture and “wrap” it around your sphere. Click on 8 Ball Texture in the Project window to select it. <u>Once it’s selected</u>, <strong>drag it onto your sphere</strong>.</p>&#13;

<p>Programming is a skill, and the more practice you get writing C# code, the better your coding skills will get. That’s why we designed the Unity Labs throughout this book to specifically <strong>help you practice your C# skills</strong> and reinforce the C# tools and concepts that you learn in each chapter. As you write more C# code, you’ll get better at it, and that’s a really effective way to become a great C# developer. Neuroscience tells us that we learn more effectively when we experiment, so we designed these Unity Labs with lots of options for experimentation, and suggestions for how you can get creative and keep going with each lab.</p>&#13;
<p>But Unity gives us an even more important opportunity to help get important C# concepts and techniques into your brain. When you’re learning a new programming language, it’s really helpful to see how that language works with lots of different platforms and technologies. That’s why we included both console apps and WPF apps in the main chapter material, and in some cases even have you build the same project using both technologies. Adding Unity to the mix gives you a third perspective, which can really accelerate your understanding of C#.</p>&#13;

<p>The <strong>GitHub for Unity extension</strong> (<a href="https://unity.github.com">https://unity.github.com</a>) lets you save your Unity projects in GitHub. Here’s how:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li><p><strong>To install GitHub for Unity:</strong> Go to <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com">https://assetstore.unity.com</a> and add GitHub for Unity to your assets. Go back to Unity, <strong>choose Package Manager</strong> from the Window menu, select “GitHub for Unity” from “My Assets,” and import it. You’ll need to import GitHub into each new Unity project.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>To push your changes to a GitHub repo:</strong> Choose GitHub from the Window menu. Each Unity project is stored in a separate repository in your GitHub account, so <strong>click the Initialize button</strong> to initialize a new <em>local</em> repo (you’ll be prompted to log into GitHub), then <strong>click the Publish button</strong> to create a new repo in your GitHub account for your project. Any time you want to push your changes to GitHub, <strong>go to the Changes tab</strong> in the GitHub window, <strong>click All</strong>, enter a <strong>commit summary</strong> (any text will do), and <strong>click Commit at</strong> the bottom of the GitHub window. Then click <strong>Push (1)</strong> at the top of the GitHub window to push your changes back to GitHub.</p></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>You can also back up and share your Unity projects with <strong>Unity Collaborate</strong>, which lets you publish your projects to their cloud storage. Your Unity Personal account comes with 1 GB of cloud storage for free, which is enough for all of the Unity Lab projects in this book. Unity will even keep track of your project history (which doesn’t count against your storage limit). To publish your project, click the <strong>Collab (<span class="inlineimage"><img alt="Images" src="assets/098fig02.png"/></span>) button</strong> on the toolbar, then click Publish. Use the same button to publish any updates. To see your published projects, log into <a href="https://unity3d.com">https://unity3d.com</a> and use the account icon to view your account, then click the Projects link from your account overview page to see your projects.</p>&#13;

<p><a data-primary="components" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46402347726216"/><a data-primary="Inspector window (Unity)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46402347725064"/><strong>Q: I’m still not clear on exactly what a component is. What does it do, and how is it different from a GameObject?</strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>A:</strong> A GameObject doesn’t actually do much on its own. All a GameObject really does is serve as a <em>container</em> for components. When you used the GameObject menu to add a Sphere to your scene, Unity created a new GameObject and added all of the components that make up a sphere, including a Transform component to give it position, rotation, and scale, a default Material to give it its plain white color, and a few other components to give it its shape, and help your game figure out when it bumps into other objects. These components are what make it a sphere.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Q: So does that mean I can just add any component to a GameObject and it gets that behavior?</strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, exactly. When Unity created your scene, it added two GameObjects, one called Main Camera and another called Directional Light. If you click on Main Camera in the Hierarchy window, you’ll see that it has three components: a Transform, a Camera, and an Audio Listener. If you think about it, that’s all a camera actually needs to do: be somewhere, and pick up visuals and audio. The Directional Light GameObject just has two components: a Transform and a Light, which casts light on other GameObjects in the scene.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Q: If I add a Light component to any GameObject, does it become a light?</strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes! A light is just a GameObject with a Light component. If you click on the Add Component button at the bottom of the Inspector and add a Light component to your ball, it will start emitting light. If you add another GameObject to the scene, it will reflect that light.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Q: It sounds like you’re being careful with the way you talk about light. Is there a reason you talk about emitting and reflecting light? Why don’t you just say that it glows?</strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>A:</strong> Because there’s a difference between a GameObject that emits light and one that glows. If you add a Light component to your ball, it will start emitting light—but it won’t look any different, because the Light only affects other GameObjects in the scene that reflect its light. If you want your GameObject to glow, you’ll need to change its material or use another component that affects how it’s rendered.</p>&#13;

<p>We built these Unity Labs to give you a <strong>platform to experiment on your own with C#</strong> because that’s the single most effective way for you to become a great C# developer. At the end of every Unity Lab, we’ll include a few suggestions for things that you can try on your own. Take some time to experiment with everything you just learned before moving on to the next chapter:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li><p>Add a few more spheres to your scene. Try using some of the other billiard ball maps. You can download them all from the same location where you downloaded <em>8 Ball Texture.png</em> from.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Try adding other shapes by choosing Cube, Cylinder, or Capsule from the GameObject &gt;&gt; 3D Object menu.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Experiment with using different images as textures. See what happens to photos of people or scenery when you use them to create textures and add them to different shapes.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Can you create an interesting 3D scene out of shapes, textures, and lights?</p></li>&#13;
