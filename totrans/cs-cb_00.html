<h1>Why I Wrote This Book</h1>

<p>In the course of a career, we collect many tools. Whether concepts, techniques, <span class="keep-together">patterns</span>, or reusable code, these tools help us get our job done. The more we collect, the better, because we have so many problems to solve and applications to build. <span class="keep-together"><em>C# Cookbook</em></span> contributes to your toolset by providing you with a variety of recipes.</p>

<p>Things change over time, including programming languages. As of this writing, the C# programming language is over 20 years old, and software development has changed during its lifetime. There are a lot of recipes that could be written; this book acknowledges the evolution of C# over time and the fact that modern C# code makes us more productive.</p>

<p>This book is full of recipes that I’ve used throughout my career. In addition to stating a problem, presenting code, and explaining the solution, each discussion includes deeper insight into why each recipe is important. Throughout the book, I’ve avoided advocacy of process or absolute declarations of “you must do it this way” because much of what we do in creating software requires trade-offs. In fact, you’ll find several discussions of what the consequences or trade-offs are with a recipe. This respects the fact that you can consider to what extent a recipe applies to you.</p>

<h1>Who This Book Is For</h1>

<p>This book assumes that you already know basic C# syntax. That said, there are recipes for various levels of developers. Whether you’re a beginner, intermediate, or senior developer, there should be something for you. If you’re an architect, there might be some interesting recipes that help you get back up to speed on the latest C# <span class="keep-together">techniques</span>.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="How This Book Is Organized"><div class="sect1" id="idm45678812554528">
<h1>How This Book Is Organized</h1>

<p>When brainstorming for this book, the entire focus was on answering the question “What do C# developers need to do?” Looking at the list, certain patterns emerged and evolved into chapters:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>One of the first things I do when writing code is to build the types and organize the application. So I wrote <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.xhtml#constructing_apps_and_types">Chapter 1</a> to show how to create and organize types. You’ll see recipes dealing with patterns because that’s how I code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After creating types, we add type members, like methods, and the logic they contain, which is a natural category of recipes for <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.xhtml#coding_algorithms">Chapter 2</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What good is code unless it works well? That’s why I added <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.xhtml#ensuring_quality">Chapter 3</a>, which contains recipes that help improve the quality of code. While this chapter is packed with useful recipes, you’ll want to check out the recipe that shows how to use nullable reference types.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>While Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch01.xhtml#constructing_apps_and_types">1</a> through <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch03.xhtml#ensuring_quality">3</a> follow the “What do C# developers need to do?” theme, from <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.xhtml#querying_with_linq">Chapter 4</a> to the end of the book I break away, taking a technology-specific focus:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Many people think of Language Integrated Query (LINQ) as a database technology. While LINQ is useful for working with databases, it’s also excellent for in-memory data manipulation and querying. That’s why <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.xhtml#querying_with_linq">Chapter 4</a> discusses what you can do with the in-memory provider, called LINQ to Objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflection was part of C# 1, but dynamic programming came along later in C# 4. I think it’s important to discuss both technologies in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.xhtml#implementing_dynamic_and_reflection">Chapter 5</a> and even show how dynamic programing can be better than reflection in some situations. Also, be sure to check out the Python interop recipes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Async programming was a great addition to C# and seems straightforward, on the surface. <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.xhtml#programming_asynchronously">Chapter 6</a> covers async with recipes that explain several important features you might not be aware of.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All apps use data, whether securing, parsing, or serializing. <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.xhtml#manipulating_data">Chapter 7</a> includes several recipes covering different things you want to do with data. It focuses on some of the newer libraries and algorithms you might want to use for working with data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the largest transformations of the C# language occurred over the last few versions in the area of pattern matching. There are so many that I was able to fill <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.xhtml#matching_with_patterns">Chapter 8</a> with only pattern-matching recipes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C# continues to evolve and <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.xhtml#examining_recent_csharp_langauge_highlights">Chapter 9</a> captures recipes dedicated to C# 9. We’ll look at some of the new features and discuss how to apply them. While I provide insight in the discussion, remember that sometimes new features can become more integral to a language in later versions. If you’re into the cutting edge, these recipes are pretty interesting.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>From concept to delivery, there are many people involved in creating a new book. I would like to recognize the people who helped on <em>C# Cookbook</em>.</p>

<p>Amanda Quinn, Senior Content Acquisitions Editor, helped form the concept for the book and provided feedback as I outlined its contents. Angela Rufino, Content Development Editor, got me started on standards and tools, provided feedback on my writing, and was incredibly helpful during the entire process. Bassam Alugili, Octavio Hernandez, and Shadman Kudchikar were tech editors, correcting errors, adding excellent insight, and sharing new ideas. Katherine Tozer, Production Editor and Vendor Coordinator, kept me up to date on new early releases and coordinated other production items. Justin Billing, Copyeditor, did a great job at improving my writing. There are many other people behind the scenes that made this book possible.</p>

<p>I would like to thank all of you. I am grateful for your contributions and wish you all the best.</p>
