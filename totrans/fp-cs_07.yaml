    `Bind` method, but there’s also a state object that’s passed along as well, that
    is used as an additional object to the calculations. In C#, we’re just as well
    using a LINQ `Aggregate` function, or a Maybe `Bind` function with a tuple or
    something similar to pass the necessary state objects through.

- en: As you can see from the list above, there are many other monads available in
    the world of functional programming, but I’d argue that most or all of them don’t
    provide any real benefit to us. At the end of the day, C# is a hybrid functional/object-oriented
    language. It has been extended to allow support for functional programming concepts,
    but it’s never going to be a purely functional language, and there’s no benefit
    to trying to treat it as such.

    goodness. We’ve already talked holidays in our examples this chapter, so this
    time I’m going to focus on how we’re actually going to get to the airport - this
    will need a series of look-ups, data transformations and all of which would normally
    require error handling and branching logic if we were to follow a more conventional,
    Object-oriented approach. I hope you’ll agree that using functional programming
    techniques and monads, it looks quite considerably more elegant.

- en: Firstly, there’s no error handling anywhere. Any of those external dependencies
    could result in an error being throwm, or no details being located in their respective
    data stores. The monad `Bind` function handles all of that logic. If - for example
    - the router was unable to determine a route (maybe a network error occurred),
    then the Maybe would be set to an `Error<Route>` at that point, and none of the
    subsequent operations would be executed. The final return type would be `Error<decimal>`,
    because the `Error` class is re-created at each step, but the actual `Exception`
    is passed between instances. The outside world is responsible for doing something
    with the final returned value, until that .

- en: If we followed the OO approach to this code, then the function would most likely
    be 2-3 times longer, in order to include `Try/Catch` blocks and checks against
    each object to confirm that they’re valid.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ve used Tuples in cases where I want to build up a set of inputs. In the case
    of the Address objects, this means that in the event that the first address isn’t
    found, the lookup for the second won’t be attempted. It also means that both of
    the inputs required by the second function to be run are available in a single
    location, which we can then access with another `Bind` call (assuming there’s
    a real value returned by the address lookup).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The final few steps don’t actualy involve calls to external dependencies, but
    by continuing to use the `Bind` function, anything inside its parameter lambda
    expression can be written with the assumption that there is a real value available,
    because if there weren’t, the lambda wouldn’t be executed.
