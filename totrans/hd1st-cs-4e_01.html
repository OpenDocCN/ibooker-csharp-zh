<h1>Who is this book for?</h1>&#13;
<p>If you can answer “yes” to all of these:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p>Do you want to <strong>learn C#</strong> (and pick up some knowledge of game development and Unity along the way)?</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Do you like to tinker? Do you learn by doing, rather than just reading?</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Do you prefer <strong>interesting and stimulating conversation</strong> to <strong>dry</strong>, <strong>dull</strong>, <strong>academic lectures</strong>?</p></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p>this book is for you.</p>&#13;

<h2>Who should probably avoid this book?</h2>&#13;
<p>If you can answer “yes” to any of these:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p>Are you more interested in theory than practice?</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Does the idea of doing projects and writing code make you bored and a little twitchy?</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Are you <strong>afraid to try something different</strong>? Do you think a book about serious topic like development needs to be serious all the time?</p></li>&#13;

<h1>And we know what your brain is thinking.</h1>&#13;
<p>Your brain craves novelty. It’s always searching, scanning, <em>waiting</em> for something unusual. It was built that way, and it helps you stay alive.</p>&#13;
<p>So what does your brain do with all the routine, ordinary, normal things you encounter? Everything it <em>can</em> to stop them from interfering with the brain’s <em>real</em> job—recording things that <em>matter</em>. It doesn’t bother saving the boring things; they never make it past the “this is obviously not important” filter.</p>&#13;
<p>How does your brain <em>know</em> what’s important? Suppose you’re out for a day hike and a tiger jumps out in front of you. What happens inside your head and body?</p>&#13;
<p>Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. <em>Chemicals surge</em>.</p>&#13;
<p>And that’s how your brain knows…</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/xxxifig01.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p><strong>This must be important! Don’t forget it!</strong></p>&#13;
<p>But imagine you’re at home, or in a library. It’s a safe, warm, tiger-free zone. You’re studying. Getting ready for an exam. Or trying to learn some tough technical topic your boss thinks will take a week, ten days at the most.</p>&#13;
<p>Just one problem. Your brain’s trying to do you a big favor. It’s trying to make sure that this <em>obviously</em> unimportant content doesn’t clutter up scarce resources. Resources that are better spent storing the really <em>big</em> things. Like tigers. Like the danger of fire. Like how you should never have posted those “party” photos on your Facebook page.</p>&#13;
<p>And there’s no simple way to tell your brain, “Hey brain, thank you very much, but no matter how dull this book is, and how little I’m registering on the emotional Richter scale right now, I really <em>do</em> want you to keep this stuff around.”</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Metacognition: thinking about thinking" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="metacognition_thinking_about_thinking">&#13;
<h1>Metacognition: thinking about thinking</h1>&#13;
<p>If you really want to learn, and you want to learn more quickly and more deeply, pay attention to how you pay attention. Think about how you think. Learn how you learn.</p>&#13;
<p>Most of us did not take courses on metacognition or learning theory when we were growing up. We were <em>expected</em> to learn, but rarely <em>taught</em> to learn.</p>&#13;
<p>But we assume that if you’re holding this book, you really want to learn how to build programs in C#. And you probably don’t want to spend a lot of time on it. If you want to use what you read in this book, you need to <em>remember</em> what you read. And for that, you’ve got to <em>understand</em> it. To get the most from this book, or <em>any</em> book or learning experience, take responsibility for your brain. Your brain on <em>this</em> content.</p>&#13;
<p>The trick is to get your brain to see the new material you’re learning as Really Important. Crucial to your well-being. As important as a tiger. Otherwise, you’re in for a constant battle, with your brain doing its best to keep the new content from sticking.</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/xxxiiifig01.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p><strong>So just how DO you get your brain to treat C# like it was a hungry tiger?</strong></p>&#13;
<p>There’s the slow, tedious way, or the faster, more effective way. The slow way is about sheer repetition. You obviously know that you <em>are</em> able to learn and remember even the dullest of topics if you keep pounding the same thing into your brain. With enough repetition, your brain says, “This doesn’t <em>feel</em> important, but they keep looking at the same thing <em>over</em> and <em>over</em> and <em>over</em>, so I suppose it must be.”</p>&#13;
<p>The faster way is to do <strong><em>anything that increases brain activity</em></strong>, especially different <em>types</em> of brain activity. The things on the previous page are a big part of the solution, and they’re all things that have been proven to help your brain work in your favor. For example, studies show that putting words <em>within</em> the pictures they describe (as opposed to somewhere else on the page, like in a caption or in the body text) causes your brain to try to make sense of how the words and pictures relate, and this causes more neurons to fire. More neurons firing = more chances for your brain to <em>get</em> that this is something worth paying attention to, and possibly recording.</p>&#13;
<p>A conversational style helps because people tend to pay more attention when they perceive that they’re in a conversation, since they’re expected to follow along and hold up their end. The amazing thing is, your brain doesn’t necessarily <em>care</em> that the “conversation” is between you and a book! On the other hand, if the writing style is formal and dry, your brain perceives it the same way you experience being lectured to while sitting in a roomful of passive attendees. No need to stay awake.</p>&#13;
<p>But pictures and conversational style are just the beginning.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Here’s what WE did" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="hereapostrophes_what_we_did">&#13;
<h1>Here’s what WE did</h1>&#13;
<p>We used <strong><em>pictures</em></strong>, because your brain is tuned for visuals, not text. As far as your brain’s concerned, a picture really <em>is</em> worth a thousand words. And when text and pictures work together, we embedded the text <em>in</em> the pictures because your brain works more effectively when the text is <em>within</em> the thing the text refers to, as opposed to in a caption or buried in the text somewhere.</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/xxxivfig01.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>We used <strong><em>redundancy</em></strong>, saying the same thing in <em>different</em> ways and with different media types, and <em>multiple senses</em>, to increase the chance that the content gets coded into more than one area of your brain.</p>&#13;
<p>We used concepts and pictures in <strong><em>unexpected</em></strong> ways because your brain is tuned for novelty, and we used pictures and ideas with at least <em>some</em> <strong><em>emotional</em></strong> <em>content</em>, because your brain is tuned to pay attention to the biochemistry of emotions. That which causes you to <em>feel</em> something is more likely to be remembered, even if that feeling is nothing more than a little <strong><em>humor</em></strong>, <strong><em>surprise</em></strong>, or <strong><em>interest.</em></strong></p>&#13;
<p>We used a personalized, <strong><em>conversational style</em></strong>, because your brain is tuned to pay more attention when it believes you’re in a conversation than if it thinks you’re passively listening to a presentation. Your brain does this even when you’re <em>reading</em>.</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/xxxivfig02.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>We included dozens of <strong><em>activities</em></strong>, because your brain is tuned to learn and remember more when you <strong><em>do</em></strong> things than when you <em>read</em> about things. And we made the paper puzzles and code exercises challenging yet doable, because that’s what most people<em/> prefer.</p>&#13;
<p>We used <strong><em>multiple learning styles</em></strong>, because <em>you</em> might prefer step-by-step procedures, while someone else wants to understand the big picture first, and someone else just wants to see an example. But regardless of your own learning preference, <em>everyone</em> benefits from seeing the same content represented in multiple ways.</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/xxxivfig03.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>We included content for <strong><em>both sides of your brain</em></strong>, because the more of your brain you engage, the more likely you are to learn and remember, and the longer you can stay focused. Since working one side of the brain often means giving the other side a chance to rest, you can be more productive at learning for a longer period of time.</p>&#13;
<p>And we included <strong><em>stories</em></strong> and exercises that present <strong><em>more than one point of view</em></strong>, because your brain is tuned to learn more deeply when it’s forced to make evaluations and judgments.</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/xxxivfig04.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>We included <strong><em>challenges</em></strong>, with exercises, and asked <strong><em>questions</em></strong> that don’t always have a straight answer, because your brain is tuned to learn and remember when it has to <em>work</em> at something. Think about it—you can’t get your <em>body</em> in shape just by <em>watching</em> people at the gym. But we did our best to make sure that when you’re working hard, it’s on the <em>right</em> things. That <strong><em>you’re not spending one extra dendrite</em></strong> processing a hard-to-understand example, or parsing difficult, jargon-laden, or overly terse text.</p>&#13;
<p>We used <strong><em>people</em></strong>. In stories, examples, pictures, etc., because, well, because <em>you’re</em> a person. And your brain pays more attention to <em>people</em> than it does to <em>things</em>.</p>&#13;

<h1>Here’s what YOU can do to bend your brain into submission</h1>&#13;
<p>So, we did our part. The rest is up to you. These tips are a starting point; listen to your brain and figure out what works for you and what doesn’t. Try new things.</p>&#13;

</div>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Slow down. The more you understand, the less you have to memorize.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Don’t just <em>read</em>. Stop and think. When the book asks you a question, don’t just skip to the answer. Imagine that someone really<em/> <em>is</em><em/> asking the question. The more deeply you force your brain to think, the better chance you have of learning and remembering.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Do the exercises. Write your own notes.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>We put them in, but if we did them for you, that would be like having someone else do your workouts for you. And don’t just <em>look</em><em/> at the exercises. <strong>Use a pencil</strong>. There’s plenty of evidence that physical activity <em>while</em> learning can increase the learning.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Read the “There are no Dumb Questions” sections.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>That means all of them. They’re not optional sidebars—<strong><em>they’re part of the core content!</em></strong> Don’t skip them.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Make this the last thing you read before bed. Or at least the last challenging thing.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Part of the learning (especially the transfer to long-term memory) happens <em>after</em> you put the book down. Your brain needs time on its own, to do more processing. If you put in something new during that processing time, some of what you just learned will be lost.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Drink water. Lots of it.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Your brain works best in a nice bath of fluid. Dehydration (which can happen before you ever feel thirsty) decreases cognitive function.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Talk about it. Out loud.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Speaking activates a different part of the brain. If you’re trying to understand something, or increase your chance of remembering it later, say it out loud. Better still, try to explain it out loud to someone else. You’ll learn more quickly, and you might uncover ideas you hadn’t known were there when you were reading about it.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Listen to your brain.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Pay attention to whether your brain is getting overloaded. If you find yourself starting to skim the surface or forget what you just read, it’s time for a break. Once you go past a certain point, you won’t learn faster by trying to shove more in, and you might even hurt the process.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Feel something.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Your brain needs to know that this <em>matters</em>. Get involved with the stories. Make up your own captions for the photos. Groaning over a bad joke is <em>still</em><em/> better than feeling nothing at all.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Write a lot of code!</strong></p>&#13;
<p>There’s only one way to <em>really</em> learn C# so it sticks: <strong>write a lot of code</strong>. And that’s what you’re going to do throughout this book. Coding is a skill, and the only way to get good at it is to practice. We’re going to give you a lot of practice: every chapter has exercises that pose a problem for you to solve. Don’t just skip over them—a lot of the learning happens when you solve the exercises. If you get stuck, don’t be afraid to <strong>peek at the solution</strong>! We included a solution to each exercise for a reason: it’s easy to get snagged on something small. But try to solve the problem before you look at the solution. And definitely get it working before you move on to the next part of the book.</p></li>&#13;

<h1>README</h1>&#13;
<p>This is a learning experience, not a reference book. We deliberately stripped out everything that might get in the way of learning whatever it is we’re working on at that point in the book. And the first time through, you need to begin at the beginning, because the book makes assumptions about what you’ve already seen and learned.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>The activities are NOT optional.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>The puzzles and activities are not add-ons; they’re part of the core content of the book. Some of them are to help with memory, some for understanding, and some to help you apply what you’ve learned. <strong><em>Don’t skip the written problems.</em></strong> The pool puzzles are the only things you don’t <em>have</em> to do, but they’re good for giving your brain a chance to think about twisty little logic puzzles—and they’re definitely a great way to really speed up the learning process.</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/xxxvifig01.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p><strong>The redundancy is intentional and important.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>One distinct difference in a Head First book is that we want you to <em>really</em> get it. And we want you to finish the book remembering what you’ve learned. Most reference books don’t have retention and recall as a goal, but this book is about <em>learning</em>, so you’ll see some of the same concepts come up more than once.</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/xxxvifig02.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p><strong>Do all the exercises!</strong></p>&#13;
<p>The one big assumption that we made when we wrote this book is that you want to learn how to program in C#. So we know you want to get your hands dirty right away, and dig right into the code. We gave you a lot of opportunities to sharpen your skills by putting exercises in every chapter. We’ve labeled some of them “<em>Do this!</em>”—when you see that, it means that we’ll walk you through all of the steps to solve a particular problem. But when you see the Exercise logo with the running shoes, then we’ve left a big portion of the problem up to you to solve, and we gave you the solution that we came up with. Don’t be afraid to peek at the solution—<strong>it’s not cheating</strong>! But you’ll learn the most if you try to solve the problem first.</p>&#13;
<p>We’ve also included all the exercise solutions source code with the rest of the code from this book. You can find all of it on our GitHub page: <a href="https://github.com/head-first-csharp/fourth-edition">https://github.com/head-first-csharp/fourth-edition</a>.</p>&#13;

<p><strong>The “Brain Power” questions don’t have answers.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>For some of them, there is no right answer, and for others, part of the learning experience is for you to decide if and when your answers are right. In some of the Brain Power questions you will find hints to point you in the right direction.</p>&#13;

<p><strong>We’re targeting C# 8.0, Visual Studio 2019, and Visual Studio 2019 for Mac.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>This book is all about helping you learn C#. The team at Microsoft that develops and maintains C# releases updates to the language. <strong>C# 8.0</strong> is the current version at the time this book is going to into production. We also lean very heavily on Visual Studio, Microsoft’s integrated development environment (IDE), as a tool for learning, teaching, and exploring C#. The screenshots in this book were taken with the <strong>latest versions of Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio 2019 for Mac</strong> available at the time of production. We included instructions for installing Visual Studio in <a href="ch01.html#start_building_with_chash_build_somethin">#start_building_with_chash_build_somethin</a>, and for installing Visual Studio for Mac in the <em>Visual Studio for Mac Learner’s Guide</em> appendix.</p>&#13;
<p>We’re on the cusp of C# 9.0, which will be released not long after this book comes out. It has some great new features! The features of C# that are part of the core learning in this book will be unchanged, so you will be able to use this book with future versions of C#. The Microsoft teams that maintain Visual Studio and Visual Studio for Mac routinely release updates, and <em>very rarely</em> those changes will affect screenshots in this book.</p>&#13;
<p>The Unity Lab sections in this book target <strong>Unity 2020.1</strong>, the latest version of Unity available as this book is going into production. We included instructions for installing Unity in the first Unity Lab.</p>&#13;

<p><span class="inlineimage"><img alt="Images" src="assets/game.png"/></span> <strong>How we use games in this book</strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>Game design... and beyond</strong></p>&#13;
<p>You’re going to be writing code for lots of projects throughout this book, and many of those projects are games. We didn’t do this just because we love games. Games can be <strong><em>effective tools for learning and teaching C#</em></strong>. Here’s why:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li><p>Games are <strong>familiar</strong>. You’re about to immerse yourself in a lot of new concepts and ideas. Giving you something familiar to grab onto can make the learning process go more smoothly.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Games make it easier to <strong>explain projects</strong>. When you do any of the projects in this book, the first thing you need to do is understand what we’re asking you to build—and that can be surprisingly difficult. When we use games for our projects, that makes it easier for you to quickly figure out what we’re asking and dive right into the code.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Games are <strong>fun to write</strong>! Your brain is much more receptive to new information when you’re having fun, so including coding projects where you’ll build games is, well, a no-brainer (excuse the pun).</p></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p><strong>We use games throughout this book to <em>help you learn broader C# and programming concepts</em>. They’re an important part of the book. You should do all of the game-related projects in the book, even if you’re not interested in game development. (The Unity Labs are optional, but strongly recommended.)</strong></p>&#13;

<p><strong>Tatiana Mac</strong> is an independent American engineer who works directly with organizations to build clear and coherent products and design systems. She believes the trifecta of accessibility, performance, and inclusion can work symbiotically to improve our social landscape digitally and physically. When ethically minded, she thinks technologists can dismantle exclusionary systems in favor of community-focused, inclusive ones.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">We totally agree with Tatiana on this!</span></p>&#13;
