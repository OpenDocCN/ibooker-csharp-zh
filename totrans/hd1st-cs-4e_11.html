<p><strong>Need an object to do a specific job? Use an interface.</strong> Sometimes you need to group your objects together based on the <strong>things they can do</strong> rather than the classes they inherit from—and that’s where <strong>interfaces</strong> come in. You can use an interface to define a <strong>specific job</strong>. Any instance of a class that <strong>implements</strong> the interface is <em>guaranteed to do that job</em>, no matter what other classes it’s related to. To make it all work, any class that implements an interface must promise to <strong>fulfill all of its obligations</strong>...or the compiler will break its kneecaps, see?</p>&#13;

<h1>The beehive is under attack!</h1>&#13;
<p>An enemy hive is trying to take over the Queen’s territory, and keeps sending enemy bees to attack her workers. So she’s added a new elite Bee subclass called HiveDefender to defend the hive.</p>&#13;

<h2>So we need a DefendHive method, because enemies can attack at any time</h2>&#13;
<p>We can add a HiveDefender subclass to the Bee class hierarchy by extending the Bee class, overriding its CostPerShift with the amount of honey each defender consumes every shift, and overriding the DoJob method to fly out to the enemy hive and attack the enemy bees.</p>&#13;
<p>But enemy bees can attack at any time. We want defenders to be able to defend the hive <strong><em>whether or not they’re currently doing their normal jobs.</em></strong></p>&#13;
<p>So in addition to DoJob, we’ll add a DefendHive method to any Bee that can defend the hive—not just the elite HiveDefender workers, butany of their sisters who can take up arms and protect their Queen. The Queen will call her workers’ DefendHive methods any time she sees that her hive is under attack.</p>&#13;

<h1>We can use <u>casting</u> to call the DefendHive method...</h1>&#13;
<p><a data-primary="casting" data-secondary="calling methods using" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46402343018344"/>When you coded the Queen.DoJob method, you used a foreach loop to get each Bee reference in the <code>workers</code> array, then you used that reference to call worker.DoJob. If the hive is under attack, the Queen will want to call her defenders’ DefendHive methods. So we’ll give her a HiveUnderAttack method that gets called any time the hive is being attacked by enemy bees, and she’ll use a foreach loop to order her workers to defend the hive until all of the attackers are gone.</p>&#13;
<p>But there’s a problem. The Queen can use the Bee references to call DoJob because each subclass overrides Bee.DoJob, but she can’t use a Bee reference to call the DefendHive method, because that method isn’t part of the Bee class. So how does she call DefendHive?</p>&#13;
<p>Since DefendHive is only defined in each subclass, we’ll need to use <code>casting</code> to convert the Bee reference to the correct subclass in order to call its DefendHive method.</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">public void HiveUnderAttack() {&#13;
    foreach (Bee worker in workers) {&#13;
        if (EnemyHive.AttackingBees &gt; 0) {&#13;
            if (worker.Job == "Hive Defender") {&#13;
                HiveDefender defender = <strong>(HiveDefender)</strong> worker;&#13;
                defender.DefendHive();&#13;
            } else if (worker.Job == "Nectar Defender") {&#13;
                NectarDefender defender = <strong>(NectarDefender)</strong> defender;&#13;

<h2>...but what if we add more Bee subclasses that can defend?</h2>&#13;
<p>Some honey manufacturer and egg care bees want to step up and defend the hive, too. That means we’ll need to add more <code>else</code> blocks to her HiveUnderAttack method.</p>&#13;
<p><strong><em>This is getting complex.</em></strong> The Queen.DoJob method is nice and simple—a very short foreach loop that takes advantage of the Bee class model to call the specific version of the DoJob method that was implemented in the subclass. We can’t do that with DefendHive because it’s not part of the Bee class—and we don’t want to add it, because not all bees can defend the hive. <strong><em>Is there a better way to have <u>unrelated classes do the same job</u>?</em></strong></p>&#13;

<p>So if we wanted to add defenders to the hive, we could have an interface called IDefend. Here’s what that looks like. It uses the <code><strong>interface</strong></code> <strong>keyword</strong> to define the interface, and it includes a single member, an abstract method called Defend. All members in an interface are public and abstract by default, so C# keeps things simple by having you <strong><em>leave off the <code>public</code> and <code>abstract</code> keywords:</em></strong></p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/358fig01.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>Any class that implements the IDefend interface <strong>must include a Defend method</strong> whose declaration matches the one in the interface. If it doesn’t, the compiler will give an error.</p>&#13;

<h2>...but there’s no limit to the number of interfaces a class can implement</h2>&#13;
<p>We just said that you use a colon (:) to make a class implement an interface. What if that class is already using a colon to extend a base class? No problem! <strong>A class can implement many different interfaces, even if it already extends a base class:</strong></p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/358fig02.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>Now we have a class that can act like a NectarCollector, but can also defend the hive. NectarCollector extends Bee, so if you <strong>use it from a Bee reference</strong> it acts like a Bee:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">    Bee worker = new NectarCollector();&#13;
    Console.WriteLine(worker.Job);&#13;
    worker.WorkTheNextShift();</pre>&#13;
<p>But if you <strong>use it from an IDefend reference</strong>, it acts like a hive defender:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">    IDefend defender = new NectarCollector();&#13;
    defender.Defend();</pre>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p><strong>When a class implements an interface, it <u>must include</u> all of the methods and properties listed inside the interface or the code won’t build.</strong></p>&#13;

<h1>Interfaces let <u>unrelated</u> classes do the same job</h1>&#13;
<p>Interfaces can be a really powerful tool to help you design C# code that’s easy to understand and build. Start by thinking about <strong>specific jobs that classes need to do</strong>, because that’s what interfaces are all about.</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/359fig01.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>So how does this help the Queen? The IDefender interface lives <u>entirely outside the Bee class hierarchy</u>. So we can add a NectarDefender class that knows how to defend the hive, and <strong><em>it can still extend NectarCollector</em></strong>. The Queen can keep an array of all of her defenders:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">IDefender[] defenders = new IDefender[2];&#13;
defenders[0] = new HiveDefender();&#13;
defenders[1] = new NectarDefender();</pre>&#13;
<p>That makes it easy for her to rally her defenders:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">private void DefendTheHive() {&#13;
  foreach (IDefender defender in defenders)&#13;
  {&#13;
     defender.Defend();&#13;
  }&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<p>And since it lives outside of the Bee class model, we can do this <strong><em>without modifying any existing code.</em></strong></p>&#13;

<p><strong>We’re going to give you a lot of examples of interfaces.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Still a little puzzled about how interfaces work and why you would use them? Don’t worry—that’s normal! The syntax is pretty straightforward, but there’s <strong>a lot of subtlety</strong>.

Go ahead and <strong>create a new Console App</strong> project.</p>&#13;
<p><strong><em>Do this!</em></strong></p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Add the Main method.</strong> Here’s the code for a class called TallGuy, along with code for the Main method that instantiates it using an object initializer and calls its TalkAboutYourself method. There’s nothing new here—we’ll use it in a minute:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">class TallGuy {&#13;
    public string Name;&#13;
    public int Height;&#13;
&#13;
    public void TalkAboutYourself() {&#13;
        Console.WriteLine($"My name is {Name} and I’m {Height} inches tall.");&#13;
    }&#13;
}&#13;
class Program&#13;
{&#13;
    static void Main(string[] args)&#13;
    {&#13;
        TallGuy tallGuy = new TallGuy() { Height = 76, Name = "Jimmy" };&#13;
        tallGuy.TalkAboutYourself();&#13;
    }&#13;
}</pre></li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Add an interface.</strong> We’re going to make TallGuy implement an interface. Add a new IClown interface to your project: right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer, <strong>select Add &gt;&gt; New Item...(Windows) or Add &gt;&gt; New File... (Mac), and choose Interface</strong>. Make sure it’s called <em>IClown.cs</em>. The IDE will create an interface that includes the interface declaration. Add a Honk method:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">interface IClown&#13;
{&#13;
    void Honk();&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>You don’t <u>need</u> to add “public” or “abstract” inside the interface, because it automatically makes every property and method public and asbtract.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Try coding the rest of the IClown interface.</strong> Before you go on to the next step, see if you can create the rest of the IClown interface, and modify the TallGuy class to implement this interface. In addition to the void method called Honk that doesn’t take any parameters, your IClown interface should also have a read-only string property called FunnyThingIHave that has a get accessor but no set accessor.</p>&#13;
<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="interface_names_start_with_i">&#13;
<h5><strong>Interface names start with I</strong></h5>&#13;
<p>Whenever you create an interface, you should make its name start with an uppercase I. There’s no rule that says you <span style="color:#9D9EA0;">need</span> to do it, but it makes your code a lot easier to understand. You can see for yourself just how much easier that can make your life. Just go into the IDE to any blank line inside any method and type “I”—IntelliSense shows .NET interfaces.</p>&#13;
</div></aside></li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Here’s the IClown interface.</strong> Did you get it right? It’s OK if you put the Honk method first—the order of the members doesn’t matter in an interface, just like it doesn’t matter in a class.</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">interface IClown&#13;
{&#13;
    string FunnyThingIHave { get; }&#13;
    void Honk();&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>The IClown interface requires any class that implements it to have a void method called Honk and a string property called FunnyThingIHave that has a get accessor.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Modify the TallGuy class so that it implements IClown.</strong> Remember, the colon operator is always followed by the base class to inherit from (if any), and then a list of interfaces to implement, all separated by commas. Since there’s no base class and only one interface to implement, the declaration looks like this:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">class TallGuy: <strong>IClown</strong></pre>&#13;
<p>Then make sure the rest of the class is the same, including the two fields and the method. Select Build Solution from the Build menu in the IDE to compile and build the program. You’ll see two errors:</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/361fig01.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Fix the errors by adding the missing interface members.</strong> The errors will go away as soon as you add all of the methods and properties defined in the interface. So go ahead and implement the interface. Add a read-only string property called FunnyThingIHave with a get accessor that always returns the string “big shoes”. Then add a Honk method that writes “Honk honk!” to the console.</p>&#13;
<p>Here’s what it’ll look like:</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/361fig02.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Now your code will compile.</strong> Update your Main method so that it prints the TallGuy object’s FunnyThingIHave property and then calls its Honk method:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">static void Main(string[] args) {&#13;
    TallGuy tallGuy = new TallGuy() { Height = 76, Name = "Jimmy" };&#13;
    tallGuy.TalkAboutYourself();&#13;
    Console.WriteLine($"The tall guy has {tallGuy.FunnyThingIHave}");&#13;
    tallGuy.Honk();&#13;
}</pre></li>&#13;

<h2>If you try to instantiate an interface, your code won’t build</h2>&#13;
<p>You can create an array of IWorker references, but you can’t instantiate an interface. What you <em>can</em> do is point those references at new instances of classes that implement IWorker. Now you can have an array that holds many different kinds of objects!</p>&#13;
<p>If you try to instantiate an interface, the compiler will complain.</p>&#13;

<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>You can’t use the <code>new</code> keyword with an interface, which makes sense—the methods and properties don’t have any implementation. If you could create an object from an interface, how would it know how to behave?</p>&#13;

<p>So you can’t instantiate an interface...but you <strong><em>can</em> use the interface to make a reference variable</strong>, and use it to reference an object that <strong><em>implements</em></strong> the interface.</p>&#13;
<p>Remember how you could pass a Tiger reference to any method that expects an Animal, because Tiger extends Animal? Well, this is the same thing—you can use an instance of a class that implements IDefender in any method or statement that expects an IDefender.</p>&#13;

When you work with an interface reference, it’s just another way to refer to the same objects you’ve already been using. Let’s take a closer look at how interfaces would be used to reference objects in the heap.</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p><strong>We’ll start by creating objects as usual.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Here’s code to create some bees: it creates an instance of HiveDefender and an instance of NectarDefender—and both of those classes implement the IDefender interface.</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">HiveDefender bertha = new HiveDefender();&#13;
NectarDefender gertie = new NectarDefender();</pre>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/369fig01.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Next we’ll add IDefender references.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>You can use interface references just like you use any other reference type. These two statements use interfaces to create <strong>new references to existing objects</strong>. You can only point an interface reference at an instance of a class that implements it.</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">IDefender def2 = gertie;&#13;
IDefender captain = bertha;</pre>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/369fig02.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>An interface reference will keep an object alive.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>When there aren’t any references pointing to an object, it disappears. There’s no rule that says those references all have to be the same type! An interface reference is just as good as any other object reference when it comes to keeping track of objects so they don’t get garbage-collected.</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/369fig03.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Use an interface like any other type.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>You can create a new object with a <code>new</code> statement and assign it straight to an interface reference variable in a single line of code. You can <strong>use interfaces to create arrays</strong> that can reference any object that implements the interface.</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">IDefender[] defenders = new IDefender[3];&#13;
defenders[0] = new HiveDefender();&#13;
defenders[1] = bertha;&#13;
defenders[2] = captain;</pre>&#13;

It can do the work of three different bees, and best of all it doesn’t consume any honey! It’s not exactly environmentally friendly, though—it runs on gas. So how can we use interfaces to integrate RoboBee into the hive’s day-to-day business?</p>&#13;

<p>Let’s take a close look at the class diagram to see how we can use an interface to integrate a RoboBee class into the Beehive Management System. Remember, we’re using dotted lines to show that an object implements an interface.</p>&#13;

<p>Now all we need to do is modify the Beehive Management System to use the IWorker interface instead of the abstract Bee class any time it needs to reference a worker.</p>&#13;

<p>Your job is to add the IWorker interface to your project, then refactor your code to make the Bee class implement it and modify the Queen class so it only uses IWorker references. Here’s what the updated class diagram looks like:</p>&#13;

<li><p>Add the IWorker interface to your Beehive Management System project.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Modify the Bee class to implement IWorker.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Modify the Queen class to replace any Bee reference with an IWorker reference.</p></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>If that doesn’t sound like much code, that’s because it’s not. After you add the interface, you only need to change one line of code in the Bee class and three lines of code in the Queen class.</p>&#13;

<p>Your job was to modify the Beehive Management System to use the IWorker interface instead of the abstract Bee class any time it needs to reference a worker. You had to add the IWorker interface, then modify the Bee and Queen classes. This didn’t take a lot of code—that’s because using interfaces doesn’t require a lot of extra code.</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><strong>Any class can implement <u>ANY</u> interface as long as it keeps the promise of implementing the interface’s methods and properties.</strong></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p><strong>First you added the IWorker interface to your project</strong></p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">interface IWorker&#13;
{&#13;
    string Job { get; }&#13;
    void WorkTheNextShift();&#13;

Does that mean I can only use automatic properties when I implement an interface?</strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>A:</strong> No, not at all. It’s true that a property inside an interface looks very similar to an automatic property—like the Job property in the IWorker interface on the next page—but they’re definitely not automatic properties. You could implement the Job property like this:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">public Job {&#13;
    get; private set; &#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<p>You need that private set, because automatic properties require you to have both a set and a get (even if they’re private). Alternatively, you could implement it like this:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">public Job {&#13;
  get {&#13;
    return "Egg Care";    &#13;
  }&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<p>and the compiler will be perfectly happy with that. You can also add a setter—the interface requires a get, but it doesn’t say you can’t have a set, too. (If you use an automatic property to implement it, you can decide for yourself whether you want the set to be private or public.)</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Q: Isn’t it weird that there are no access modifiers in my interfaces? Should I be marking methods and properties public?</strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>A:</strong> You don’t need the access modifiers because everything in an interface is automatically public by default. If you have an interface that has this:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">void Honk();</pre>&#13;
<p>It says that you need a public void method called Honk, but it doesn’t say what that method needs to do. It can do anything at all—no matter what it does, the code will compile as long as some method is there with the right signature.</p>&#13;
<p>Does that look familiar? That’s because we’ve seen it before—in abstract classes, back in <a href="ch06.html#inheritance_your_objectapostrophes_famil">#inheritance_your_objectapostrophes_famil</a>. When you declare methods or properties in an interface without bodies, they’re <strong>automatically public and abstract</strong>, just like the abstract members that you used in your abstract classes. They work just like any other abstract methods or properties—because even though you’re not using the <strong>abstract</strong> keyword, it’s implied. That’s why every class that implements an interface <strong>must implement every member</strong>.</p>&#13;
<p>The folks who designed C# could have made you mark each of those members public and abstract, but it would have been redundant. So they made the members public and abstract by default to make it all clearer.</p>&#13;

<p><strong>Everything in a public interface is automatically public, because you’ll use it to define the public methods and properties of any class that implements it.</strong></p>&#13;

<p>Does something seem a bit odd about that? It does to us. We think it’s a <strong>hack</strong>, or a clumsy, inelegant solution. Why do we think the Jobproperty is a hack? Imagine what would happen if you had a typo like this:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">class EggCare : Bee {&#13;
   public EggCare(Queen queen) : base("Egg C<u><strong>ra</strong></u>e")&#13;
&#13;
   <span style="color:#9D9EA0;">// Oops! Now we’ve got a bug in the EggCare class,</span>&#13;

}</pre>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>We misspelled “Egg Care”—that’s a mistake anyone could make! Can you imagine how hard it would be to track down the bugs that this simple typo would cause?</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p>Now the code has no way to figure out if a Worker reference is pointing to an instance of EggCare. That would be a really nasty bug to try to fix. So we know this code is error-prone...but how is it a hack?</p>&#13;
<p>We’ve talked about <strong>separation of concerns</strong>: all of the code to address a specific problem should be kept together. The Job property <strong><em>violates the principle of separation of concerns</em></strong>. If we have a Worker reference, we shouldn’t need to check a string to figure out whether it points to an EggCare object or a NectarCollector object. The Job property returns “Egg Care” for an EggCare object and “Nectar Collector” for a NectarCollector object and is <u>only</u> used to check the object’s type. But we’re already keeping track of that information: <strong><em>it’s the object’s type</em></strong>.</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/373fig01.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;

<p><strong>That’s right! C# gives you tools to work with types.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>You don’t ever need a property like Job to keep track of the type of a class with strings like “Egg Care” or “Nectar Collector”. C# gives you tools that let you check the type of an object.</p>&#13;

Right now the Queen has her <code>workers</code> array, which means that all she can get is an IWorker reference. She uses the Job property to figure out which workers are EggCare workers and which ones are NectarCollectors:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">foreach (IWorker worker in workers) {&#13;
if (worker.Job == "Egg Care") {&#13;
    WorkNightShift((EggCare)worker);&#13;
}&#13;
&#13;
void WorkNightShift(EggCare worker) {&#13;
   <span style="color:#9D9EA0;">// Code to work the night shift</span>&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<p>We just saw how that code will fail miserably if we accidentally type “Egg Crae” instead of “Egg Care”. And if you set a HoneyManufacturer’s Job to “Egg Care” accidentally, you’ll get one of those InvalidCastException errors. It would be great if the compiler could detect problems like that as soon as we write them, just like we use private or abstract members to get it to detect other kinds of problems.</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/375fig01.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>C# gives us a tool to do exactly that: we can use the <code><strong>is</strong></code> <strong>keyword</strong> to check an object’s type. If you have an object reference, you can <strong>use <code>is</code> to find out if it’s a specific type:</strong></p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">  <strong>objectReference is ObjectType newVariable</strong></pre>&#13;
<p>If the object that objectReference is pointing to has ObjectType as its type, then it returns true and creates a new reference called <code>newVariable</code> with that type.</p>&#13;
<p>So if the Queen wants to find all of her EggCare workers and have them work a night shift, she can use the <code>is</code> keyword:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">  <strong>foreach (IWorker worker in workers) {</strong>&#13;
      <strong>if (worker is EggCare eggCareWorker) {</strong>&#13;
          <strong>WorkNightShift(eggCareWorker);</strong>&#13;
      <strong>}</strong>&#13;
  <strong>}</strong></pre>&#13;
<p>The <code>if</code> statement in this loop uses <code>is</code> to check each IWorker reference. Look closely at the conditional test:</p>&#13;

<p><em><strong>Do this!</strong></em></p>&#13;
<p>Create a new console app and <strong>add these Animal, Hippo, Canine, and Wolf classes</strong> to it:</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;

<p><strong>In <a href="ch06.html#inheritance_your_objectapostrophes_famil">#inheritance_your_objectapostrophes_famil</a> we learned that we could use different references to call different methods on the same object. When you didn’t use the override and virtual keywords, if your reference variable had the type Locksmith it called Locksmith.ReturnContents, but if it was a JewelThief type it called JewelThief.ReturnContents. We’re doing something similar here.</strong></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p>Next, fill in the Main method. Here’s what it does:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li><p>It creates an array of Hippo and Wolf objects, then uses a foreach loop to go through each of them.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>It uses the Animal reference to call the MakeNoise method.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>If it’s a Hippo, the Main method calls its Hippo.Swim method.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>If it’s a Wolf, the Main method calls its Wolf.HuntInPack method.</p></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>The problem is that if you have an Animal reference pointing to a Hippo object, you can’t use it to call Hippo.Swim:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">    Animal animal = new Hippo();&#13;
    animal.Swim(); <span style="color:#9D9EA0;">// &lt;-- this line will not compile!</span></pre>&#13;
<p>It doesn’t matter that your object is a Hippo. If you’re using an Animal variable, you can only access the fields, methods, and properties of Animal.</p>&#13;
<p>Luckily, there’s a way around this. If you’re 100% sure that you have a Hippo object, then you can <strong>cast your Animal reference to a Hippo</strong>—and then you can access its Hippo.Swim method:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">    Hippo hippo = (Hippo)animal;&#13;
    hippo.Swim(); <span style="color:#9D9EA0;">// It’s the same object, but now you can call the Hippo.Swim method.</span></pre>&#13;
<p>Here’s <strong>the Main method that uses the</strong> <code><strong>is</strong></code> <strong>keyword</strong> to call Hippo.Swim or Wolf.HuntInPack:</p>&#13;

<p><strong>Take a few minutes and use the debugger to really understand what’s going on here. Put a breakpoint on the first line of the foreach loop; add watches for <code>animal, hippo</code>, and <code>wolf</code>; and step through it.</strong></p>&#13;

<h1>What if we want different animals to swim or hunt in packs?</h1>&#13;
<p>Did you know that lions are pack hunters? Or that tigers can swim? And what about dogs, which hunt in packs AND swim? If we want to add the Swim and HuntInPack methods to all of the animals in our zoo simulator model that need them, the  foreach loop is just going to get longer and longer.</p>&#13;
<p>The beauty of defining an abstract method or property in a base class and overriding it in a subclass is that <strong>you don’t need to know anything about the subclass</strong> to use it. You can add all of the Animal subclasses you want, and this loop will still work:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">foreach (Animal animal in animals) {&#13;
    animal.MakeNoise();&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<p>The MakeNoise method will <strong>always be implemented by the object.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>In fact, you can treat it like a <strong>contract</strong> that the compiler enforces.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p><strong>So is there a way to treat the HuntInPack and Swim methods like contracts too, so we can use more general variables with them­—just like we do with the Animal class?</strong></p>&#13;

OK, that’s a good start. Now we want to write code that works with objects that swim or hunt in packs­—and that’s where interfaces shine. Let’s use the <code><strong>interface</strong></code> <strong>keyword</strong> to define two interfaces and <strong>add an abstract member</strong> to each interface:</p>&#13;

<p>Next, <strong>make the Hippo and Wolf classes implement the interfaces</strong> by adding an interface to the end of each class declaration. Use a <strong>colon</strong> (:) to implement an interface, just like you do when you’re extending a class. If it’s already extending a class, you just add a comma after the superclass and then the interface name. Then you just need to make sure the class <strong>implements <u>all</u> the interface members</strong>, or you’ll get a compiler error.</p>&#13;

<p>All NectarCollectors are Bees (meaning they extend the Bee base class), so you can always use the = operator to take a reference to a NectarCollector and assign it to a Bee variable.</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">  HoneyManufacturer lily = new HoneyManufacturer();&#13;
  Bee hiveMember = lily;</pre>&#13;
<p>And since Bee implements the IWorker interface, you can safely convert it to an IWorker reference too.</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">  HoneyManufacturer daisy = new HoneyManufacturer();&#13;
  IWorker worker = daisy;</pre>&#13;
<p>Those type conversions are <u>safe</u>: they’ll never throw an IllegalCastException because they only assign more specific objects to variables with more general types <em>in the same class hierarchy</em>.</p>&#13;
<p><span class="inlineimage"><img alt="Images" src="assets/380fig02.png"/></span> <strong>You <u>can’t</u> safely convert a Bee reference to a NectarCollector reference.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>You can’t <u>safely</u> go in the other direction—converting a Bee to a NectarCollector—because not all Bee objects are instances of NectarCollector. A HoneyManufacturer is <em>definitely not</em> a NectarCollector. So this:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">  IWorker pearl = new HoneyManufacturer();&#13;
  NectarCollector irene = (NectarCollector)pearl;</pre>&#13;
<p>is an <strong>invalid cast</strong> that tries to cast an object to a variable that doesn’t match its type.</p>&#13;
<p><span class="inlineimage"><img alt="Images" src="assets/380fig03.png"/></span> <strong>The “is” keyword lets you convert types <u>safely.</u></strong></p>&#13;
<p>Luckily, <strong>the <code>is</code> keyword is safer than casting with parentheses</strong>. It lets you check that the type matches, and only casts the reference to a new variable if the types match.</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">  if (pearl is NectarCollector irene) {&#13;
     <span style="color:#9D9EA0;">/* Code that uses a NectarCollector object */</span>&#13;

It also does safe type conversion. Here’s how it works. Let’s say you have an IWorker reference called <code>pearl</code>, and you want to safely cast it to a NectarCollector variable <code>irene</code>. You can convert it safely to a NectarCollector like this:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting"> NectarCollector irene = pearl as NectarCollector;</pre>&#13;
<p>If the types are compatible, this statement sets the <code>irene</code> variable to reference the same object as the <code>pearl</code> variable. If the type of the object doesn’t match the type of the variable, it doesn’t throw an exception. Instead, it just <strong>sets the variable to <code>null</code></strong>, which you can check with an <code>if</code> statement:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting"> if (irene != null) {&#13;
    <span style="color:#9D9EA0;">/* Code that uses a NectarCollector object */</span>&#13;

<p><strong>The “is” keyword works differently in very old versions of C#.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>The <code><em>is</em></code> keyword has been in C# for a long time, but it wasn’t until C# 7.0 was released in 2017 that <code><em>is</em></code> let you declare a new variable. So if you’re using Visual Studio 2015, you won’t be able to do this:   <code><em>if (pearl is NectarCollector irene) { ... }</em></code></p>&#13;
<p>Instead, you’ll need to use the <code><em>as</em></code> keyword to do the conversion, then test the result to see if it’s <code><em>null</em></code>:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">NectarCollector irene = pearl as NectarCollector;&#13;

<p>In <a href="ch06.html#inheritance_your_objectapostrophes_famil">#inheritance_your_objectapostrophes_famil</a> we talked about how you can always use a subclass in place of the base class it inherits from, but you can’t always use a base class in place of a subclass that extends it. You can also think about this another way: in a sense, you’re <strong>moving up or down the class hierarchy</strong>. For example, if you start with this:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">   NectarCollector ida = new NectarCollector();</pre>&#13;
<p>You can use the = operator to do normal assignment (for superclasses) or casting (for interfaces). That’s like <strong><em>moving up</em></strong> the class hierarchy. This is called <strong>upcasting</strong>:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">  <span style="color:#9D9EA0;">// Upcast the NectarCollector to a Bee</span>&#13;
  Bee beeReference = ida;&#13;
&#13;
  <span style="color:#9D9EA0;">// This upcast is safe because all Bees are IWorkers</span>&#13;
  IWorker worker = (IWorker)beeReference;</pre>&#13;
<p>And you can navigate in the other direction by using the <code>is</code> operator to safely <strong><em>move down</em></strong> the class hierarchy. This is called <strong>downcasting</strong>:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting"><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">  // Downcast the IWorker to NectarCollector</span>&#13;
  if (worker is NectarCollector rose) { <span style="color:#9D9EA0;">/* code that uses the rose reference */</span> }</pre>&#13;

So if you were writing a program to monitor your electricity consumption, you’d probably just write an Appliance class. But if you needed to distinguish a coffee maker from an oven, you’d have to build a class hierarchy and add the methods and properties that are specific to a coffee maker or oven to your CoffeeMaker and Oven classes, which would inherit from an Appliance class that has their common methods and properties.</p>&#13;
<p>Then you could write a method to monitor the power consumption:</p>&#13;

It’s a really powerful tool to use when you build class hierarchies. The only drawback to upcasting is that you can only use the properties and methods of the base class. In other words, when you treat a CoffeeMaker like an Appliance, you can’t tell it to make coffee or fill it with water. You <em>can</em> tell whether or not it’s plugged in, since that’s something you can do with any Appliance (which is why the PluggedIn property is part of the Appliance class).</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Let’s create some objects.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Let’s start by creating instances of the CoffeeMaker and Oven classes as usual:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">  CoffeeMaker misterCoffee = new CoffeeMaker();&#13;
  Oven oldToasty = new Oven();</pre>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p><strong>You don’t need to add this code to an app—just read through the code and start to get a sense of how upcasting and downcasting work. You’ll get <span style="color:#9D9EA0;"><u>lots</u></span> of practice with them later in the book.</strong></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>What if we want to create an array of Appliances?</strong></p>&#13;
<p>You can’t put a CoffeeMaker in an Oven[] array, and you can’t put an Oven in a CoffeeMaker[] array. You <strong><em>can</em></strong> put both of them in an Appliance[] array:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">  Appliance[] kitchenWare = new Appliance[2];&#13;
  kitchenWare[0] = misterCoffee;&#13;
  kitchenWare[1] = oldToasty;</pre>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>You can use upcasting to create an array of Appliances that can hold both CoffeeMakers and Ovens.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>But you can’t treat just <u>any</u> Appliance like an Oven.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>When you’ve got an Appliance reference, you can <strong>only</strong> access the methods and properties that have to do with appliances. You <strong>can’t</strong> use the CoffeeMaker methods and properties through the Appliance reference <strong><em>even if you know it’s really a CoffeeMaker</em></strong>. So these statements will work just fine, because they treat a CoffeeMaker object like an Appliance:</p>&#13;

<p><a data-primary="Appliance project" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46402342514616"/><a data-primary="as keyword" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46402342513272"/><a data-primary="downcasting" data-secondary="about" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46402342512472"/>Upcasting is a great tool, because it lets you use a CoffeeMaker or an Oven anywhere you just need an Appliance. But it’s got a big drawback—if you’re using an Appliance reference that points to a CoffeeMaker object, you can only use the methods and properties that belong to Appliance. That’s where <strong>downcasting</strong> comes in: that’s how you take your <strong>previously upcast reference</strong> and change it back. You can figure out if your Appliance is really a CoffeeMaker using the <code><strong>is</strong></code> keyword, and if it is you can convert it back to a CoffeeMaker.</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p><strong>We’ll start with the CoffeeMaker we already upcast.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Here’s the code that we used:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">  Appliance powerConsumer = new CoffeeMaker();&#13;
  powerConsumer.ConsumePower();</pre></li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>What if we want to turn the Appliance back into a CoffeeMaker?</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Let’s say we’re building an app that looks in an array of Appliance references so it can make our CoffeeMaker start brewing. We can’t just use our Appliance reference to call the CoffeeMaker method:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">  Appliance someAppliance = appliances[5];&#13;
  someAppliance.StartBrewing()</pre>&#13;
<p>That statement won’t compile—you’ll get that “‘Appliance’ does not contain a definition for ‘StartBrewing’” compiler error because StartBrewing is a member of CoffeeMaker but you’re using an Appliance reference.</p>&#13;

<img alt="Images" src="assets/385fig001.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure></li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>But since we know it’s a CoffeeMaker, let’s use it like one.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>The <code>is</code> keyword is the first step. Once you know that you’ve got an Appliance reference that’s pointing to a CoffeeMaker object, you can use <code><strong>is</strong></code> to downcast it. That lets you use the CoffeeMaker class’s methods and properties. Since CoffeeMaker inherits from Appliance, it still has its Appliance methods and properties.</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">  if (someAppliance is CoffeeMaker javaJoe) {&#13;
     javaJoe.StartBrewing();&#13;
  }</pre>&#13;

<p><a data-primary="downcasting" data-secondary="interfaces and" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46402342493320"/><a data-primary="interfaces" data-secondary="downcasting and" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46402342491640"/><a data-primary="interfaces" data-secondary="upcasting and" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46402342490584"/><a data-primary="reference variables" data-secondary="multiple references to single object" data-tertiary="accessing different methods and properties" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46402342489400"/><a data-primary="upcasting" data-secondary="interfaces and" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46402342488056"/>Interfaces work really well  with upcasting and downcasting. Let’s add an ICooksFood interface for any class that can heat up food. Next, we’ll add a Microwave class—both Microwave and Oven implement the ICooksFood interface. Now a reference to an Oven object can be an ICooksFood reference, a Microwave reference, or an Oven reference. That means we have three different types of references that could point to an Oven object—and each of them can access different members, depending on the reference’s type. Luckily, the IDE’s IntelliSense can help you figure out exactly what you can and can’t do with each of them:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">Oven misterToasty = new Oven();&#13;
misterToasty.</pre>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/386fig01.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>As soon as you type the dot, the IntelliSense window will pop up with a list of all of the members you can use. <code>misterToasty</code> is an Oven reference pointing to an Oven object, so it can access <u><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">all</span></u> of the methods and properties. It’s the <span style="color:#9D9EA0;"><u>most specific type</u></span>, so you can only point it at Oven objects.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/386fig04.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>To access ICooksFood interface members, convert it to an ICooksFood reference:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">if (misterToasty is ICooksFood cooker) {&#13;
    cooker.</pre>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;

<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p><code>cooker</code> is an ICooksFood reference pointing to that same Oven object. It can only access ICooksFood members, but it can also point to a Microwave object.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p>This is the same Oven class that we used earlier, so it also extends the Appliance base class. If you use an Appliance reference to access the object, you’ll only see members of the Appliance class:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">if (misterToasty is Appliance powerConsumer)&#13;
    powerConsumer.</pre>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;

<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p><code>powerConsumer</code> is an Appliance reference. It only lets you get to the public fields, methods, and properties in Appliance. It’s more general than an Oven reference (so you could point it at a CoffeeMaker object if you wanted to).</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>Three different references that point to the <span style="color:#9D9EA0;">same</span> object can access <span style="color:#9D9EA0;">different</span> methods and properties, depending on the reference’s <span style="color:#9D9EA0;">type</span>.</p>&#13;

<p><strong><a data-primary="interfaces" data-secondary="why use" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46402342462872"/>Q: So back up—I think you told me that I can always upcast but I can’t always downcast. Why?</strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>A:</strong> Because an upcast won’t work if you’re trying to set an object equal to a class that it doesn’t inherit from or an interface that it doesn’t implement. The compiler can figure out immediately that you didn’t upcast properly and give you an error. When we say “you can always upcast but can’t always downcast” it’s just like saying “every oven is an appliance but not every appliance is an oven.”</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Q: I read online that an interface is like a contract, but I don’t really get why. What does that mean?</strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, many people like to say that an interface is like a contract. (“How is an interface like a contract?” is a really common question during job interviews.) When you make your class implement an interface, you’re telling the compiler that you promise to put certain methods into it. The compiler will hold you to that promise. That’s like a court forcing you to stick to the terms of a contract. If that helps you understand interfaces, then definitely think of them that way.</p>&#13;
<p>But we think that it’s easier to remember how interfaces work if you think of an interface as a kind of checklist. The compiler runs through the checklist to make sure that you actually put all of the methods from the interface into your class. If you didn’t, it’ll bomb out and not let you compile.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Q: Why would I want to use an interface? It seems like it’s just adding restrictions, without actually changing my class at all.</strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>A:</strong> Because when your class implements an interface, you can use that interface as a type to declare a reference that can point to any instance of a class that implements it. That’s really useful to you—it lets you create one reference type that can work with a whole bunch of different kinds of objects.</p>&#13;
<p>Here’s a quick example. A horse, an ox, a mule, and a steer can all pull a cart. In our zoo simulator, Horse, Ox, Mule, and Steer would all be different classes. Let’s say you had a cart-pulling ride in your zoo, and you wanted to create an array of any animal that could pull carts around. Uh-oh—you can’t just create an array that will hold all of those. If they all inherited from the same base class you could create an array of those, but it turns out that they don’t. So what’ll you do?</p>&#13;
<p>That’s where interfaces come in handy. You can create an IPuller interface that has methods for pulling carts around. Then you can declare your array like this:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">IPuller[] pullerArray;</pre>&#13;
<p>Now you can put a reference to any animal you want in that array, as long as it implements the IPuller interface.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>An interface is like a <span style="color:#9D9EA0;">checklist</span> that the compiler runs through to make sure your class implemented a certain set of methods.</p>&#13;

Since there’s no actual method body in any interface, you don’t have to worry about calling base class constructors or methods. The inherited interfaces <strong>accumulate all of the members</strong> of the interfaces that they extend.</p>&#13;
<p>So what does this look like in code? Let’s add an IDefender interface that inherits from IWorker:</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/388fig001.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>When a class implements an interface, it must implement every property and method in that interface. If that interface inherits from another one, then all of <em>those</em> properties and methods need to be implemented, too. So any class that implements IDefender not only must implement all of the IDefender members, but also all of the IWorker members. Here’s a class model that includes IWorker and IDefender, and <strong>two separate hierarchies</strong> that implement them.</p>&#13;

<ol>&#13;
<li><p>Start with the IClown interface you created earlier:</p>&#13;

<li><p>Create these classes that implement the interfaces:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li><p>A <strong>class called FunnyFunny</strong> that implements IClown. It uses a <u>private</u> string variable called funnyThingIHave to store a funny thing. The FunnyThingIHave getter uses funnyThingIHave as a backing field. Use a constructor that takes a parameter and uses it to set the private field. The Honk method prints: <em>“Hi kids! I have a ”</em> followed by the funny thing and a period.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>A <strong>class called ScaryScary</strong> that implements IScaryClown. It uses a private variable to store an integer called scaryThingCount. The constructor sets both the scaryThingCount field and the funnyThingIHave field that ScaryScary inherited from FunnyFunny. The ScaryThingIHave getter returns a string with the number from the constructor followed by <em>“ spiders”</em>. The ScareLittleChildren method writes <em>“Boo! Gotcha! Look at my...!”</em> to the console, replacing “...” with the clown’s scary thing.</p></li>&#13;

<p>The IScaryClown interface extends IClown and adds a property and a method:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">interface IScaryClown : IClown&#13;
{&#13;
    string ScaryThingIHave { get; }&#13;
    void ScareLittleChildren();&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>The IScaryClown interface <span style="color:#9D9EA0;"><u>inherits</u></span> from the IClown interface. That means any class that implements IScaryClown not only needs to have a ScaryThingIHave property and a ScareLittleChildren method, but also a FunnyThingIHave property and a Honk method.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p>The FunnyFunny class implements the IClown interface and uses a constructor to set a backing field:</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/390fig01.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>The ScaryScary class extends the FunnyFunny class and implements the IScaryClown interface. Its constructor uses the <code>base</code> keyword to call the FunnyFunny constructor to set the private backing field:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">class ScaryScary : FunnyFunny, IScaryClown&#13;
{&#13;
&#13;
    private int scaryThingCount;&#13;

&#13;
    public string ScaryThingIHave { get { return $"{scaryThingCount} spiders"; } }&#13;

    public void ScareLittleChildren()&#13;
    {&#13;
        Console.WriteLine($"Boo! Gotcha! Look at my {ScaryThingIHave}!");&#13;
    }&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>FunnyFunny.funnyThingIHave is a private field, so ScaryScary can’t access it—it needs to use the <code><strong>base</strong></code> keyword to call the FunnyFunny constructor.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p>To fix the Main method, replace lines 3 and 4 of the method with these lines that use the <code>is</code> operator:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">if (fingersTheClown is IScaryClown iScaryClownReference)&#13;
{&#13;
    iScaryClownReference.ScareLittleChildren();&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p><strong>You can set a FunnyFunny reference equal to a ScaryScary object because ScaryScary inherits from FunnyFunny. You can’t set any IScaryClown reference to just any clown, because you don’t know if that clown is scary. That’s why you need to use the is keyword.</strong></p>&#13;

<p>An important reason that we use encapsulation is to prevent one class from accidentally overwriting another class’s data. What’s preventing a class from overwriting its own data? The “readonly” keyword can help with that. Any field that you mark readonly can only be modified in its declaration or in the constructor.</p>&#13;

<p><strong>A:</strong> When you use interfaces, you still write methods in your classes. Interfaces let you group those classes by the kind of work they do. They help you be sure that every class that’s going to do a certain kind of work does it using the same methods. The class can do the work however it needs to, and because of the interface, you don’t need to worry about how it gets the job done.</p>&#13;
<p>Here’s an example: you can have a Truck class and a Sailboat class that implement ICarryPassenger. Say the ICarryPassenger interface stipulates that any class that implements it has to have a ConsumeEnergy method. Your program could use them both to carry passengers even though the Sailboat class’s ConsumeEnergy method uses wind power and the Truck class’s method uses diesel fuel.</p>&#13;
<p>Imagine if you didn’t have the ICarryPassenger interface. Then it would be tough to tell your program which vehicles could carry people and which couldn’t. You would have to look through each class that your program might use and figure out whether or not there was a method for carrying people from one place to another. Then you’d have to call each of the vehicles your program was going to use with whatever method was defined for carrying passengers. And since there’s no standard interface, they could be named all sorts of things or buried inside other methods. You can see how that gets confusing pretty fast.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Q: Why do I need to use properties in interfaces? Can’t I just include fields?</strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>A:</strong> Good question. An interface only defines the way a class should do a specific kind of job. It’s not an object by itself, so you can’t instantiate it and it can’t store information. If you added a field that was just a variable declaration, then C# would have to store that data somewhere—and an interface can’t store data by itself. A property is a way to make something that looks like a field to other objects, but since it’s really a method, it doesn’t actually store any data.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Q: What’s the difference between a regular object reference and an interface reference?</strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>A:</strong> You already know how a regular, everyday object reference works. If you create an instance of Skateboard called <code>vertBoard</code>, and then a new reference to it called <code>halfPipeBoard</code>, they both point to the same thing. But if Skateboard implements the interface IStreetTricks and you create an interface reference to Skateboard called <code>streetBoard</code>, it will only know the methods in the Skateboard class that are also in the IStreetTricks interface.</p>&#13;
<p>All three references are actually pointing to the same object. If you call the object using the <code>halfPipeBoard</code> or <code>vertBoard</code> references, you’ll be able to access any method or property in the object. If you call it using the <code>streetBoard</code> reference, you’ll only have access to the methods and properties in the interface.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Q: Then why would I ever want to use  an interface reference, if it limits what I can do with the object?</strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>A:</strong> Interface references give you a way of working with a bunch of different kinds of objects that do the same thing. You can create an array using the interface reference type that will let you pass information to and from the methods in ICarryPassenger whether you’re working with a Truck object, a Horse object, a Unicycle object, or a Car object. The way each of those objects does the job is probably a little different, but with interface references, you know that they all have the same methods that take the same parameters and have the same return types. So, you can call them and pass information to them in exactly the same way.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Q: Remind me again why would I make a class member protected instead of private or public?</strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>A:</strong> Because it helps you encapsulate your classes better. There are a lot of times when a subclass needs access to some internal part of its base class. For example, if you need to override a property, it’s pretty common to use the backing field in the base class in the get accessor, so that it returns some sort of variation of it. When you build classes, you should only make something public if you have a reason to do it. Using the <code>protected</code> access modifier lets you expose it only to the subclass that needs it, and keep it private from everyone else.</p>&#13;

<li><p>Interfaces define their <strong>required members</strong> using abstract methods and properties.</p></li>&#13;

<li><p>Interfaces are really useful because they let <strong>unrelated</strong> classes do the <strong>same job.</strong></p></li>&#13;

Extending something means taking what’s already there and stretching it out (in this case, by adding behavior).

<p>Interfaces aren’t just about making sure classes that implement them include certain members. Sure, that’s their main job. But interfaces can also contain code, just like the other tools you use to create your class model.</p>&#13;
<p>The easiest way to add code to an interface is to add <strong>static methods, properties, and fields</strong>. These work exactly like static members in classes: they can store data of any type—including references to objects—and you can call them just like any other static method: <code>Interface.MethodName();</code></p>&#13;
<p>You can also include code in your interfaces by adding <strong>default implementations</strong> for methods. To add a default implementation, you just add a method body to the method in your interface. This method is <u>not</u> part of the object—this is not the same as inheritance—and you can only access it using an interface reference. It <u>can</u> call methods implemented by the object, as long as they’re part of the interface.</p>&#13;

So let’s update the IClown interface to add static methods that generate a clown car description. Here’s what we’ll add:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li><p>We’ll be using random numbers, so we’ll add a static reference to an instance of Random. It only needs to be used in IClown for now, but we’ll also use it in IScaryClown soon, so go ahead and mark it <code>protected</code>.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>A clown car is only funny if it’s packed with clowns, so we’ll add a static int property with a private static backing field and a setter that only accepts values over 10.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>A method called ClownCarDescription returns a string that describes the clown car.</p></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/395fig001a.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>Here’s the code—it uses a static field, property, and method just like you’d see in a class:</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/395fig001.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>Now you can update the Main method to access the static IClown members:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting"><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">static void Main(string[] args)</span>&#13;
<span style="color:#9D9EA0;">{</span>&#13;
     &#13;
   IClown.CarCapacity = 18;&#13;
   Console.WriteLine(IClown.ClownCarDescription());&#13;
   &#13;
   <span style="color:#9D9EA0;">// the rest of the Main method stays the same</span>&#13;
<span style="color:#9D9EA0;">}</span></pre>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p><strong>Try adding a <u>private field</u> to your interface. You can add one—but only if it’s static! If you remove the static keyword, the compiler will tell you that interfaces can’t contain instance fields.</strong></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p>These static interface members behave exactly like the static class members that you’ve used in previous chapters. Public members can be used from any class, private members can only be used from inside IClown, and protected members can be used from IClown or any interface that extends it.</p>&#13;

<p>But you can also provide a <strong>default implementation</strong> for any of your interface methods. Here’s an example:</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/396fig01.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>You can call the default implementation—but you <strong>must use an interface reference</strong> to make the call:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">    IWorker worker = new NectarCollector();&#13;
    worker.Buzz();</pre>&#13;
<p>But this code will not compile—it will give you the error <em>“NectarCollector’ does not contain a definition for ‘Buzz’”</em>:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">    NectarCollector pearl = new NectarCollector();&#13;
    pearl.Buzz();</pre>&#13;
<p>The reason is that when an interface method has a default implementation, that makes it a <u>virtual</u> method, just like the ones you used in classes. Any class that implements the interface has the option to implement the method. The virtual method is <strong><em>attached to the interface</em></strong>. Like any other interface implementation, <u>it’s not inherited</u>. That’s a good thing—if a class inherited default implementations from every interface that it implemented, then if two of those interfaces had methods with the same name the class would run into the Deadly Diamond of Death.</p>&#13;
<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="use_commercial_at_to_create_verbatim_str">&#13;
<h5>Use @ to create verbatim string literals</h5>&#13;
<p>The @ character has special meaning in C# programs. When you put it at the beginning of a string literal, it tells the C# compiler that the literal should be interpreted verbatim. That means slashes are not used for escape sequences—so @“\n” will contain a slash character and an n character, not a newline. It also tells the C# compiler to include any line breaks. So this: @“Line 1</p>&#13;
<p>Line 2” is the same as “Line1\nLine2” (including the line break).</p>&#13;

But there’s a problem: it only has a method to scare little children. What if we want our clowns to terrify the living $#!* out of adults too?</p>&#13;
<p>We <strong><em>could</em></strong> add an abstract ScareAdults method to the IScaryClown interface. But what if we already had dozens of classes that implemented IScaryClown? And what if most of them would be perfectly fine with the same implementation of the ScareAdults method? That’s where default implementations are really useful. A default implementation lets you add a method to an interface that’s already in use <strong>without having to update any of the classes that implement it</strong>. Add a ScareAdults method with a default implementation to IScaryClown:</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/397fig01.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p><strong><em>Add this!</em></strong></p>&#13;
<p>Take a close look at how the ScareAdults method works. That method only has two statements, but there’s a lot packed into them. Let’s break down exactly what’s going on:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li><p>The Console.WriteLine statement uses a verbatim literal with string interpolation. The literal starts with <code>$@</code> to tell the C# compiler two things: the <code>$</code> tells it to use string interpolation, and the <code>@</code> tells it to use a verbatim literal. That means the string will include three line breaks.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>The literal uses string interpolation to call <code>r</code>andom.Next(4, 10), which uses the private static random field that IScaryClown inherited from IClown.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>We’ve seen throughout the book that when there’s a static field, that means there’s <u>only one copy</u> of that field. So there’s just one instance of Random that both IClown and IScaryClown share.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>The last line of the ScareAdults method calls ScareLittleChildren. That method is <u>abstract</u> in the IScaryClown interface, so it will call the version of ScareLittleChildren in the class that implements IScaryClown.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>That means ScareAdults will call the version of ScareLittleChildren that’s defined in whatever class implements IScaryClown.</p></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>Call your new default implementation by modifying the block after the <code>if</code> statement in your Main method to call ScareAdults instead of ScareLittleChildren:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting"><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">    if (fingersTheClown is IScaryClown iScaryClownReference)</span>&#13;
<span style="color:#9D9EA0;">    {</span>&#13;
        iScaryClownReference.ScareAdults();&#13;

<p>Developers always stand on the shoulders of giants. You’re about halfway through this book, and in the first half you’ve written code that prints text to the console, draws windows with buttons, and renders 3D objects. You didn’t need to write code to specifically output individual bytes to the console, or draw the lines and text to display buttons in a window, or do the math needed to display a sphere—you took advantage of code that other people wrote:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li><p>You’ve used <strong>frameworks</strong> like .NET Core and WPF.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>You’ve used <strong>APIs</strong> like the Unity scripting API.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>The frameworks and APIs contain <strong>class libraries</strong> that you access with <code>using</code> directives at the top of your code.</p></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>And when you’re using libraries, frameworks, and APIs, you use interfaces a lot. See for yourself: open up a .NET Core or WPF application, click inside of any method, and type <code><strong>I</strong></code> to pop up an IntelliSense window. Any potential match that has the <span class="inlineimage"><img alt="Images" src="assets/398fig02a.png"/></span> symbol next to it is an interface.

<ol>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Modify the Queen class to implement the INotifyPropertyChanged interface.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>This interface lets the Queen announce that the status report has been updated.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Modify the XAML to create an instance of Queen.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>We’ll bind the TextBox.Text property to the Queen’s StatusReport property.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Modify the code-behind so the “queen” field uses the instance of Queen we just created.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Right now the queen field in <em>MainWindow.xaml.cs</em> has a field initializer with a <code>new</code> statement to create an instance of Queen. We’ll modify it to use the instance we created with XAML instead.</p>&#13;

<h1>Modify the Beehive Management System to use data binding</h1>&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Beehive Management System project" data-secondary="data binding and" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46402342209464"/>You only need to make a few changes to add data binding to your WPF app.</p>&#13;
<p><strong><em>Do this!</em></strong></p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Modify the Queen class to implement the INotifyPropertyChanged interface.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Update the Queen class declaration to make it implement INotifyPropertyChanged. That interface is in the System.ComponentModel namespace, so you’ll need to add a <code>using</code> directive to the top of the class:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">using System.ComponentModel;</pre>&#13;
<p>Now you can add <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> to the end of the class declaration. The IDE will draw a red squiggly underline beneath it—which is what you’d expect, since you haven’t implemented the interface by adding its members yet.</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/400fig01.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>Press Alt+Enter or Ctrl+. to show potential fixes <strong>and choose “Implement interface”</strong> from the context menu. The IDE will add a line of code to your class with the <code><strong>event keyword</strong></code>, which you haven’t seen yet:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;</pre>&#13;
<p>But guess what? You’ve used events before! The DispatchTimer you used in <a href="ch01.html#start_building_with_chash_build_somethin">#start_building_with_chash_build_somethin</a> has a Tick event, and WPF Button controls have a Click event. <strong><em>Now your Queen class has a PropertyChanged event.</em></strong> Any class that you use for data binding fires—or <strong>invokes</strong>—its PropertyChanged event to let WPF know a property has changed.</p>&#13;
<p>Your Queen class needs to fire its event, just like the DispatchTimer fires its Tick event on an interval and the Button fires its Click event when the user clicks on it. So <strong>add this OnPropertyChanged method</strong>:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">    protected void OnPropertyChanged(string name)&#13;
    {&#13;
        PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(name));&#13;
    }</pre>&#13;
<p>Now you just need to <strong>modify the UpdateStatusReport method</strong> to call OnPropertyChanged:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting"><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">    private void UpdateStatusReport()</span>&#13;
<span style="color:#9D9EA0;">    {</span>&#13;
<span style="color:#9D9EA0;">        StatusReport = $"Vault report:\n{HoneyVault.StatusReport}\n" +</span>&#13;
<span style="color:#9D9EA0;">        $"\nEgg count: {eggs:0.0}\nUnassigned workers: {unassignedWorkers:0.0}\n" +</span>&#13;
<span style="color:#9D9EA0;">        $"{WorkerStatus("Nectar Collector")}\n{WorkerStatus("Honey Manufacturer")}" +</span>&#13;
<span style="color:#9D9EA0;">        $"\n{WorkerStatus("Egg Care")}\nTOTAL WORKERS: {workers.Length}";</span>&#13;
        <strong>OnPropertyChanged("StatusReport");</strong>&#13;
<span style="color:#9D9EA0;">    }</span></pre>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>You added an <u><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">event</span></u> to your Queen class, and added a method that uses the <span style="color:#9D9EA0;"><u>?. operator</u></span> to invoke the event. That’s all you need to know about events for now—at the end of the book we’ll point you to a downloadable chapter that teaches you more about events.</p>&#13;
</div></li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Modify the XAML to create an instance of Queen.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>You’ve created objects with the <code>new</code> keyword, and you’ve used Unity’s Instantiate method. XAML gives you another way to create new instances of your classes. <strong>Add this to your XAML</strong> just <u>above</u> the <code>&lt;Grid&gt;</code> tag:</p>&#13;
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">&#13;
<img alt="Images" src="assets/401fig01.png"/>&#13;
<h6/>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>Next, <strong>modify the</strong> <code>&lt;Grid&gt;</code> <strong>tag</strong> to add a DataContext attribute:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting"><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">&lt;Grid</span> DataContext="{StaticResource queen}"&gt;</pre>&#13;
<p>Finally, <strong>add a Text attribute to the <code>&lt;TextBox&gt;</code> tag</strong> to bind it to the Queen’s StatusReport property:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting"><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">&lt;TextBox</span> Text="{Binding StatusReport, Mode=OneWay}"</pre>&#13;
<p>Now the TextBox will update automatically any time the Queen object invokes its PropertyChanged event.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><strong>Modify the code-behind to use the instance of Queen in the window’s resources.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Right now the queen field in <em>MainWindow.xaml.cs</em> has a field initializer with a <code>new</code> statement to create an instance of Queen. We’ll modify it to use the instance we created with XAML instead.</p>&#13;
<p>First, comment out (or delete) the three occurrences of the line that sets statusReport.Text. There’s one in the MainWindow constructor and two in the Click event handlers:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting"><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">// statusReport.Text = queen.StatusReport;</span></pre>&#13;
<p>Next, modify the Queen field declaration to remove the field initializer (<code>new Queen();</code>) from the end:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">private readonly Queen queen;</pre>&#13;
<p>Finally, modify the constructor to set the queen field like this:</p>&#13;

<p>This code uses a <strong>dictionary</strong> called Resources. <em>(This is a <u>sneak peek at dictionaries</u>! You’ll learn about them in the next chapter.)</em> Now run your game. It works exactly like before, but now the TextBox updates automatically any time the Queen updates the status report.</p>&#13;

<p><strong>Congratulations! You just used an interface to add data binding to your WPF app.</strong></p>&#13;

<h5>there are no Dumb Questions</h5>&#13;
<p><strong>Q: I think I understand everything that we just did. Can you go over it again, just in case I missed something?</strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely. The Beehive Management System app you built in <a href="ch06.html#inheritance_your_objectapostrophes_famil">#inheritance_your_objectapostrophes_famil</a> updated its TextBox (statusReport) by setting its Text property in code like this:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">statusReport.Text = queen.StatusReport;</pre>&#13;
<p>You modified that app to use data binding to automatically update the TextBox any time the Queen object updates its StatusReport property. You did this by making three changes. First, you modified the Queen class to implement the INotifyPropertyChanged interface so it could notify the UI of any changes to the property. Then you modified the XAML to create an instance of Queen and bind the TextBox.Text property to the Queen object’s StatusReport property. Finally, you modified the code-behind to use the instance created by the XAML and remove the lines that set statusReport.Text.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Q: And what exactly is the interface for?</strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>A:</strong> The INotifyPropertyChanged interface gives you a way to tell WPF that a property changed, so it can update any controls that bind to it. When you implement it, you’re building a class that can do a specific job: notifying WPF apps of property changes. The interface has a single member, an event called PropertyChanged. When you use your class for data binding, WPF checks to see if it implements INotifyPropertyChanged, and if it does, it attaches an event handler to your class’s PropertyChanged event, just like you attached event handlers to your Buttons’ click events.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Q: I noticed that when I open the window in the designer, the status report TextBox isn’t blank anymore. Is that because of data binding?</strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>A:</strong> Good eye! Yes, when you modified the XAML to add the <code>&lt;Window.Resources&gt;</code> section to create a new instance of the Queen object, the Visual Studio XAML designer created an instance of the object. When you modified the Grid to add a data context and added binding to the TextBox’s Text property, the designer used that information to display the text. So once you use data binding, your classes aren’t just being instantiated when your program runs. Visual Studio will create instances of your objects <strong><em>while you’re editing in the XAML window</em></strong>. This is a really powerful feature of the IDE, because it lets you change properties in your code and see the results in the designer as soon as you rebuild your code.</p>&#13;

<h5><span class="inlineimage"><img alt="Images" src="assets/watchit.png"/></span> Watch it!</h5>&#13;
<p><strong>Data binding works with properties, not fields.</strong></p>&#13;
<p><em>You can only use data binding with <strong>public properties</strong>. If you try to bind a WPF control attribute to a public field instead, you won’t see any changes—but you won’t get an exception, either.</em></p>&#13;

<h2>Keep your eyes open for polymorphism!</h2>&#13;
<p>You’ve been using polymorphism throughout—we just didn’t use that word to describe it. While you’re writing code over the next few chapters, be on the lookout for the many different ways you use it.</p>&#13;
<p>Here’s a list of four typical ways that you’ll use polymorphism. We’re providing an example of each of them, though you won’t see these particular lines in the exercises. As soon as you write similar code in an exercise in later chapters in the book, come back to this page and <strong>check it off the following list</strong>:</p>&#13;

<p><strong>You’re using <span style="color:#9D9EA0;">polymorphism</span> when you take an instance of one class and use it in a statement or a method that expects a different type, like a parent class or an interface that the class implements.</strong></p>&#13;

<p>There’s a name for what you’ve been doing. It’s called <strong>object-oriented programming</strong>, or OOP. Before languages like C# came along, people didn’t use objects and methods when writing their code. They just used functions (which is what they call methods in a non-OO program) that were all in one place—as if each program were just one big static class that only had static methods. It made it a lot harder to create programs that modeled the problems they were solving. Luckily, you’ll never have to write programs without OOP, because it’s a core part of C#.</p>&#13;

<p>When programmers talk about OOP, they’re referring to four important principles. They should seem very familiar to you by now because you’ve been working with every one of them. We just told you about polymorphism, and you’ll recognize the first three principles from <a href="ch05.html#encapsulation_keep_your_privateshellippr">#encapsulation_keep_your_privateshellippr</a> and <a href="ch06.html#inheritance_your_objectapostrophes_famil">#inheritance_your_objectapostrophes_famil</a>: <strong>inheritance, abstraction</strong>, and <strong>encapsulation.</strong></p>&#13;
