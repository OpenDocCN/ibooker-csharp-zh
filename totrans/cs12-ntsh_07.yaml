    data structures such as arrays or linked lists, to more complex ones such as red/black
    trees and hashtables. Although the internal implementation and external characteristics
    of these data structures vary widely, the ability to traverse the contents of
    the collection is an almost universal need. The .NET BCL supports this need via
    a pair of interfaces (`IEnumerable`, `IEnumerator`, and their generic counterparts)
    that allow different data structures to expose a common traversal API. These are
    part of a larger set of collection interfaces illustrated in [Figure 7-1](#collection_interfaces).

    if `Apple` subclasses `Fruit`, `Apple[]` can be cast to `Fruit[]`. This leads
    to the issue of why `object[]` was not used as the unifying array type rather
    than the `Array` class. The answer is that `object[]` is incompatible with both
    multidimensional and value-type arrays (and non-zero-based arrays). An `int[]`
    array cannot be cast to `object[]`. Hence, we require the `Array` class for full
    type unification.

    As with the interfaces we discussed previously, you usually have a choice of generic
    or nongeneric versions of each type. In terms of flexibility and performance,

    elements can be slow (because all elements after the insertion point must be shifted
    to make a free slot), as can removing elements (especially near the start). As

    an entry belongs to. If the bucket contains more than one value, a linear search
    is performed on the bucket. A good hash function does not strive to return strictly

    rather than having to re-create the entire thing from scratch. This reduces the
    overhead of add/remove operations from potentially *huge* (with large collections)

    slower. The end result is that most immutable collections are slower than their

    it avoids the overhead for read operations (for which it’s comparable in performance
