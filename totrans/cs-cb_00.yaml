- en: In the course of a career, we collect many tools. Whether concepts, techniques,
    patterns, or reusable code, these tools help us get our job done. The more we
    collect, the better, because we have so many problems to solve and applications
    to build. *C# Cookbook* contributes to your toolset by providing you with a variety
    of recipes.

- en: Things change over time, including programming languages. As of this writing,
    the C# programming language is over 20 years old, and software development has
    changed during its lifetime. There are a lot of recipes that could be written;
    this book acknowledges the evolution of C# over time and the fact that modern
    C# code makes us more productive.

- en: This book is full of recipes that I’ve used throughout my career. In addition
    to stating a problem, presenting code, and explaining the solution, each discussion
    includes deeper insight into why each recipe is important. Throughout the book,
    I’ve avoided advocacy of process or absolute declarations of “you must do it this
    way” because much of what we do in creating software requires trade-offs. In fact,
    you’ll find several discussions of what the consequences or trade-offs are with
    a recipe. This respects the fact that you can consider to what extent a recipe
    applies to you.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book assumes that you already know basic C# syntax. That said, there are
    recipes for various levels of developers. Whether you’re a beginner, intermediate,
    or senior developer, there should be something for you. If you’re an architect,
    there might be some interesting recipes that help you get back up to speed on
    the latest C# techniques.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'When brainstorming for this book, the entire focus was on answering the question
    “What do C# developers need to do?” Looking at the list, certain patterns emerged
    and evolved into chapters:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the first things I do when writing code is to build the types and organize
    the application. So I wrote [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#constructing_apps_and_types)
    to show how to create and organize types. You’ll see recipes dealing with patterns
    because that’s how I code.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After creating types, we add type members, like methods, and the logic they
    contain, which is a natural category of recipes for [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#coding_algorithms).
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What good is code unless it works well? That’s why I added [Chapter 3](ch03.xhtml#ensuring_quality),
    which contains recipes that help improve the quality of code. While this chapter
    is packed with useful recipes, you’ll want to check out the recipe that shows
    how to use nullable reference types.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'While Chapters [1](ch01.xhtml#constructing_apps_and_types) through [3](ch03.xhtml#ensuring_quality)
    follow the “What do C# developers need to do?” theme, from [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#querying_with_linq)
    to the end of the book I break away, taking a technology-specific focus:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many people think of Language Integrated Query (LINQ) as a database technology.
    While LINQ is useful for working with databases, it’s also excellent for in-memory
    data manipulation and querying. That’s why [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#querying_with_linq)
    discusses what you can do with the in-memory provider, called LINQ to Objects.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reflection was part of C# 1, but dynamic programming came along later in C#
    4\. I think it’s important to discuss both technologies in [Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#implementing_dynamic_and_reflection)
    and even show how dynamic programing can be better than reflection in some situations.
    Also, be sure to check out the Python interop recipes.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Async programming was a great addition to C# and seems straightforward, on the
    surface. [Chapter 6](ch06.xhtml#programming_asynchronously) covers async with
    recipes that explain several important features you might not be aware of.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All apps use data, whether securing, parsing, or serializing. [Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#manipulating_data)
    includes several recipes covering different things you want to do with data. It
    focuses on some of the newer libraries and algorithms you might want to use for
    working with data.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the largest transformations of the C# language occurred over the last
    few versions in the area of pattern matching. There are so many that I was able
    to fill [Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#matching_with_patterns) with only pattern-matching
    recipes.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: C# continues to evolve and [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#examining_recent_csharp_langauge_highlights)
    captures recipes dedicated to C# 9\. We’ll look at some of the new features and
    discuss how to apply them. While I provide insight in the discussion, remember
    that sometimes new features can become more integral to a language in later versions.
    If you’re into the cutting edge, these recipes are pretty interesting.

    the book and provided feedback as I outlined its contents. Angela Rufino, Content
    Development Editor, got me started on standards and tools, provided feedback on
    my writing, and was incredibly helpful during the entire process. Bassam Alugili,
    Octavio Hernandez, and Shadman Kudchikar were tech editors, correcting errors,
    adding excellent insight, and sharing new ideas. Katherine Tozer, Production Editor
    and Vendor Coordinator, kept me up to date on new early releases and coordinated
    other production items. Justin Billing, Copyeditor, did a great job at improving
    my writing. There are many other people behind the scenes that made this book
    possible.
