<p>Do you already have experience with another programming language? If so, you might find a <strong>code kata</strong> approach to learning to be an effective, efficient, and satisfying alternative to reading this book cover to cover.</p>
<p>“Kata” is a Japanese word that means “form” or “way,” and it’s used in many martial arts to describe a training method that involves practicing a series of movements or techniques over and over again. Many developers apply this idea to practice their programming skills by writing specific programs, often more than once. In this book, more experienced developers looking to pick up C# can <strong><em>use a code kata approach to take an <u>alternative path</u> through the chapters</em></strong>. Here’s how this will work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When you start a new chapter, <strong>flip or scroll through it</strong> until you find the first code kata element (see the following pages for instructions). Read through the nearby Bullet Points element to see what was covered.</p></li>
<li><p>The code kata element will have <strong>instructions for a specific exercise</strong> to do—usually a coding project. Try doing the project, going back to previous sections (especially Bullet Points sections) for extra guidance.</p></li>
<li><p>If you <strong>get stuck</strong> doing the exercise, then you’ve run into an area where C# is very different from the languages you already know. Go back to the previous code kata element (or the beginning of the chapter, if it’s the first one) and start reading the book linearly until you get past the code kata where you got stuck.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Unity Labs,</strong> you’ll get practice writing C# code by doing 3D game development with Unity. These labs are <em><u>not</u> required</em> for the code kata path but <u>strongly</u> recommended. They’re also very satisfying, and a really fun way to hone your newly acquired C# skills.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kata—in martial arts or in code—are meant to be repeated.</strong> So if you really want to get C# into your brain, when you finish a chapter go back through it, find the code kata sections, and do them again.</p>
<p><strong>There are no code kata for <a href="ch01.html#start_building_with_chash_build_somethin">#start_building_with_chash_build_somethin</a>.</strong> It makes sense even for an advanced developer to read this chapter in its entirety and do all of the projects and exercises, even the pencil-and-paper ones. There are foundational ideas in this chapter that the rest of the book will build on. Additionally, if you have experience with another programming language and plan to take the code kata path through this book, <strong>watch this video by Patricia Aas</strong> on learning C# as a second (or 15th) language: <a href="https://bit.ly/cs_second_language">https://bit.ly/cs_second_language</a>. This is <u>required</u> for the code kata path.</p>

<p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">Do you have <u>a lot of experience</u> with another programming language, and are you looking to learn C# for fun or work? Look for the code kata sections, starting in <a href="ch02.html#dive_into_chash_statementscomma_classesc">#dive_into_chash_statementscomma_classesc</a>, which lay out an alternate learning path through the book that’s perfect for more advanced (or impatient!) developers. Read this to see if that path will work for you.</span></p>

<h5>Chapter 2: Dive into C#</h5>

</div></figure>
<p><a href="ch02.html#dive_into_chash_statementscomma_classesc">#dive_into_chash_statementscomma_classesc</a> is about getting our readers familiar with some basic C# concepts: how code is structured into namespaces, classes, methods, and statements, and some basic syntax. It ends with a project to build a simple UI that takes input: for Windows readers, it’s a WPF desktop app; for macOS readers it’s a Blazor web app (see the <em>Visual Studio for Mac Learner’s Guide</em> appendix). The idea behind including projects like these in most of the chapters is to help readers see different approaches to solving similar problems, which can really help when learning a new language.</p>
<p>Get started by <u>skimming through the whole chapter</u> and reading <u>all of the Bullet Points sections</u>. Read through all the code samples. Does everything look pretty familiar? If so, then you’re ready to get started on some kata.</p>
<p><strong>Kata #1</strong>: Find the Do this! element in the section with the heading <strong>Generate a new method to work with variables</strong>. That’s your starting point. Add the code in that section and the following <strong>Add code that uses operators to your method</strong> section to the Console App program you created in <a href="ch01.html#start_building_with_chash_build_somethin">#start_building_with_chash_build_somethin</a>. Use the Visual Studio debugger to step through the code—the following section shows you how to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Kata #2</strong>: The next few sections have examples of <code>if</code> statements and loops to add to your app and debug.</p>
<p>Is everything making sense? If so, you’re ready to tackle the WPF project at the end of the chapter or the Blazor project in the <em>Visual Studio for Mac Learner’s Guide</em> appendix. If you feel comfortable with Visual Studio and can find your way around the IDE and create, run, and debug a .NET Core console app, you’re ready for...</p>

<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="chapter_3_objects">
<h5>Chapter 3: Objects</h5>
<p>This chapter is all about introducing the basics of classes, objects, and instances. In the first half, we work with static methods or fields (that means they belong to the type itself, and not to a specific instance); in the second half, we’ll create instances of objects. If you do—and understand—these kata, it’s safe to move on to the next chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Kata #1</strong>: The first project in this chapter is a simple program that generates random playing cards. Find the first <em><strong>Do this!</strong></em> element (next to the <strong>Create your PickRandomCards console app</strong> heading). That’s your starting point. You’ll create a class and use it in a simple program.</p>
<p><strong>Kata #2</strong>: Work through the following sections to finish the CardPicker class. You’ll reuse the same class in a WPF desktop app or Blazor web app.</p>
<p><strong>Kata #3</strong>: Flip or scroll forward to the “Sharpen your pencil” exercise where you create Clown objects. Type in the code, add comments for the answers, and then step through it.</p>
<p><strong>Kata #4</strong>: Near the end of the chapter, find the heading <strong>Build a class to work with some guys</strong>. Immediately after that is a class called Guy followed by an exercise. Do that exercise to build a simple app.</p>
<p><strong>Kata #5</strong>: Do the exercise immediately after that, where you reuse the Guy class in a simple betting game. Find at least one way to improve on the game: let the player choose different odds and bets, have multiple players, etc.</p>
<p>While you work on these programs, keep an eye out for the places in the code where you might ask these questions—they’re answered in later chapters, but noticing them now will help you pick up C# more quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Doesn’t C# have some kind of <code>switch</code> statement?</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t some people consider multiple <code>return</code> statements in a method or function bad practice?</p></li>
<li><p>Why are we using <code>return</code> to break out of a loop? Does C# have a better way to break out of a loop without returning from the method?</p></li>
</ul>

<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="chapter_4_types_and_references">
<h5><span class="inlineimage"><img alt="Images" src="assets/pg725.png"/></span> Chapter 4: Types and references</h5>
<p>This chapter is about types and references in C#. Read the first few sections of the chapter to make sure you know the different types—there are some quirks to do with floating-point numbers you should know about. Then glance through the various diagrams to make sure you understand what’s going on with references, because you’ll see similar ones throughout the book. Did you get all that? OK—go on to these three kata. If you have no trouble with them, it’s safe to move on to the next chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Kata #1</strong>: The first project in this chapter is a tool to help a role-playing game master calculate ability scores. It starts with the <strong>Let’s help Owen experiment with ability scores</strong> heading. You should be able to find and fix both the syntax error and the bug in the program without looking at the answer.</p>
<p><strong>Kata #2</strong>: Do the project in the exercise that starts with: Create a program with an Elephant class. Once you have the exercise solved, go through all of the material until you’re done with everything under the <strong>Objects use references to talk to each other</strong> heading.</p>
<p><strong>Kata #3</strong>: Do the project under the heading <strong>Welcome to Sloppy Joe’s Budget House o’ Discount Sandwiches.</strong></p>
<p>Here are some questions that you might think of—they’re addressed later in the book:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does C# differentiate between value types like double or int and reference types like Elephant, MenuItem, or Random?</p></li>
<li><p>Do we have any control over when the CLR garbage-collects objects that are no longer referenced?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the IDE have tools to track and differentiate specific instances?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking about these questions now will help you pick up C# more quickly.</p>

<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="chapter_5_encapsulation">
<h5>Chapter 5: Encapsulation</h5>
<p>This chapter is about encapsulation, which in C# means restricting access to certain class members to keep other objects from using them in ways that aren’t intended. The first project in the chapter features the kind of bug that encapsulation helps to prevent. If you can do the last kata—it involves fixing the bug you create in the first kata—without relying on the solution,  it’s safe to move on to the next chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Kata #1</strong>: The first project in this chapter is a tool to help our role-playing game master roll for damage. It starts at the beginning of the chapter—follow it up through the <strong>Sleuth it out</strong> box. Make sure you understand exactly why the program is broken. Take a quick look at the exercise at the end of the chapter. If you can do it without looking at the answer, then you’re <em>already</em> ready to move on to the next chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Kata #2</strong>: Do the project in the exercise that starts with: Let’s get a little practice using the <code>private</code> keyword by <strong>creating a small Hi-Lo game.</strong> Make sure you understand how it uses the <code>const</code>, <code>public</code>, and <code>private</code> keywords. Make sure to do the bonus problem.</p>
<p><strong>Kata #3</strong>: Do the small project in the “Watch it!” element that starts: <strong>Encapsulation is not the same as security. Private fields are <u>not</u> secure.</strong></p>
<p>Read the following sections: <strong>Properties make encapsulation easier, Auto-implemented properties simplify your code</strong>, and <strong>Use a private setter to create a read-only property.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kata #4</strong>: Do the last exercise in the chapter, where you use encapsulation to fix the SwordDamage class.</p>

<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="chapter_6_inheritance">
<h5><span class="inlineimage"><img alt="Images" src="assets/pg725.png"/></span>  Chapter 6: Inheritance</h5>
<p>This chapter is about inheritance, which in C# means creating classes that reuse, extend, and modify behavior in other classes. If you’ve been following the code kata path, it’s likely that you already know an object-oriented language with inheritance. These kata will give you the C# syntax for inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>Kata #1</strong>: The first project in this chapter expands the damage calculation app from <a href="ch04.html#types_and_references_getting_the_referen">#types_and_references_getting_the_referen</a>. It does <u>not</u> use inheritance—the purpose is to help novice readers start to understand reasons why inheritance is valuable. It also introduces the syntax of the C# <code>switch</code> statement. This should be a quick exercise for you.</p>
<p>Before you do the rest of the kata, skim the sections: <strong>Any place where you can use a base class, you can use one of its subclasses instead</strong> and <strong>Some members are only implemented in a subclass</strong>. Then skim the section <strong>A subclass can hide methods in the base class</strong> and all of its subsections.</p>
<p><strong>Kata #2</strong>: Go back and do the exercise that starts: Let’s get some practice extending a base class. This should cover the basic syntax of inheritance in C#.</p>
<p><strong>Kata #3</strong>: Do the project in the section <strong>When a base class has a constructor, your subclass needs to call it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kata #4</strong>: Do the exercise after the section <strong>It’s time to finish the job for Owen</strong>. This is a two-part exercise: the first is a pencil-and-paper exercise to fill in the class diagram, and the second has you write the code to implement it.</p>
<p>If you’ve finished the first four kata without much trouble, you’re ready to move on. However, <strong>we strongly encourage you to build the Beehive Management System app</strong> at the end of the chapter. It’s actually a pretty fun project: it teaches some useful lessons about game dynamics, and it’s very satisfying when you write just a few lines of code to change it from a turn-based game to a real-time game at the very end of the chapter.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">If you get stuck on one of the kata, then it’s most efficient for you to switch to working through the chapter linearly, starting after the last kata you finished.</span></p>
