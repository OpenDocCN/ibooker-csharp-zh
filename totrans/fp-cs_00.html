<h1>Preface</h1>


<p>Functional Programming (FP) is one of the greatest innovations in the history of software development, it’s also cool.  Fun as well.   Not only that, but it’s gaining traction year by year.</p>

<p>I attend developer’s conferences as often as I’m able, and I’ve noticed a trend.  Each year, there always seems to be more content about Functional Programming, not less.  There is often even an entire track dedicated to it, and the other talks even often include FP content somewhere as a talking point.</p>

<p>It’s slowly, but surely, becoming a big deal.  Why is that?</p>

<p>With the growth of concepts like containerization and serverless applications, FP isn’t just a bit of fun for developer’s free-time projects; it’s not a fad that’ll be forgotten in a few years.  It has real benefit to bring to our stakeholders.</p>

<p>In the .NET world there are several additional factors at play.</p>

<p>Mads Torgerson, the C# Lead Designer is himself a fan of functional programming, and one of the major driving forces behind the adoption of the functional paradigm into .NET.  There’s also F# - the .NET functional language.  F# and C# share a common runtime, consequently many functional features requested by the F# team often become available in C# in some form as well.</p>

<p>The big question though - What is it?  And<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45400887144768-marker" href="preface01.html#idm45400887144768">1</a></sup>, will I need to learn an entire new programming language just to be able to use it?  The good news is that if you’re a .NET developer, then you don’t need to spend large chunks of your own time learning a new technology just to stay up-to-date - you don’t even have to invest in another 3rd party library to add to your application’s dependencies - this is all possible with out-of-the-box C# code - albeit with a little tinkering around.</p>

<p>This book is going to introduce all the fundamental concepts of Functional Programming, demonstrate their benefits, and how they might be achieved in C# - not just for your own hobby programming, but with a very real eye towards how they can be used to bring immediate benefit to your work life as well.</p>






<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Who Should Read This Book?"><div class="sect1" id="idm45400887142368">
<h1>Who Should Read This Book?</h1>

<p>This book is intended for developers - whether professional, students, or hobbyist - who already have a basic grounding in C#.  You don’t need to be an expert, but you’ll need to be familiar with the basics, and feel comfortable putting together at least a relatively simply C# application.</p>

<p>There will be some more advanced .NET topics covered, but I’ll provide explainations when they come up.</p>

<p>This book has been written with a few different catagories of people in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Those of you that have learned the basics of C#, but want to find ways to take your learning further.  To learn more advanced techniques to write better, more robust code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>.NET developers that have heard of Functional Programming, and perhaps even know what it is, but want to know how to get started writing code that way in C#.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>F# developers looking for ways to keep using the Functional toys you’re used to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those migrating to .NET from another functional, or functional-supporting language (like Java).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone that really, truly loves coding.  If you spend all day writing code in the office, then come home to write more for fun, then this book is probably for you.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Why I wrote this book"><div class="sect1" id="idm45400888511392">
<h1>Why I wrote this book</h1>

<p>I’ve been interested in programming for as long as I can remember.  When I was a young boy, we had a ZX Spectrum - an early British home computer developed by Sinclair Research in the early 80s.  If anyone remembers the Commodore 64, it was a bit like that, but far more primitive.  It had just 15 colours<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45400888509984-marker" href="preface01.html#idm45400888509984">2</a></sup> - and one of them was black. I had the more advanced model with 48k of memory, though my Dad had the earlier machine - the ZX81 - which had a single kilobyte of memory available (and rubber keys).  It couldn’t even have colored-in character sprites, just areas of the screen, so your game avatar would change colour to that of whatever they were standing in front of. In short, it was pure awesome on toast.</p>

<p>One of the best things about it was that it had an OS that effectively consisted of a text-based programming interface, and code was required to load a game (from a cassette tape, with the command LOAD “”), but there were also magazines and books for kids with code for games you could enter yourself, and it was from these that I developed my lasting obsession with the mysteries of computer code.  Thanks so much, Usbourne Publishing!</p>

<p>When I was around 14 years old or so, a computer-based careers advice program at school suggested I could think about taking up a career in software development.  This is the first time I realised that you could take this silly hobby and turn it into something that you could actually make money from!</p>

<p>After University was over, it was time to get a proper job, and that was where I got my first exposure to C#.  So, the next step, I supposed, was to learn how to develop code <em>properly</em>.  Easy, right?  I’ll be honest, nearly 2 decades on, and I’m still trying to work that out.</p>

<p>One of the big turning points for me in my programming career was when I attended a developer’s conference in Norway, and finally started to understand what this “Functional Programming” thing I’d been hearing about was actually about.  Functional code is elegant, concise and easy to read in a way that other forms of code just don’t seem to be.  As with any type of code, it’s still possible to write horrible-looking codebases, but it still fundamentally feels like it’s finally code being done <em>properly</em>, in a way that I’ve never really felt from other styles of coding.  Hopefully after reading this book, you’ll not only agree, but be interested in searching out the many other avenues that exist out there for exploring it further.</p>

<h1>Navigating This Book</h1>

<p>This is how I’ve organized this book:</p>

<p>The introduction talks about what exactly Functional Programming is, where it comes from, and why any of us should be interested in it.  I argue that it brings significant business benefits to our employers, and that it’s a skill worth adding to your developer toolbelt.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Chapter 1 looks at what you can do right now to start coding Functionally in C#, without having to reference a single new Nuget package, 3rd party library or hack around with the language.  Nearly all of the examples in this chapter work with just about every version of C# since version 3.  This chapter represents the very first steps into Functional Programming, all fairly easy code, but it sets the groundwork for what’s to come.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 2 provides some slightly less conventional ways to look at structures already available to us in C#.  It includes ways to take the Functional Paradigm a bit futher.  At this point there are still no extra code dependencies, but things start to look a bit more unusual here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapters 4 to 7 each show a component of the Functional Programming paradigm and how you can go about implementing it in C#.  It’s in these chapters that we start to play around with the structure of C# a little.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapters 8 and 9 talk more about the practicalities of uing Functional C# in a business environment.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to dive in at the level you feel ready for.  This isn’t a novel<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45400888030352-marker" href="preface01.html#idm45400888030352">3</a></sup>, read the chapters in the order that makes sense to you.</p>

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>The very first person I should thank is Kathleen Dollard.  She gave a talk at NDC Oslo some years ago called “Functional Techniques for C#”.  It was the first real exposure I’d ever had to Functional Programming, and it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHmIf5xmKQg">a real eye-opener (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHmIf5xmKQg)</a>.</p>

<p>The other guru I’ve followed on this trail is Enrico Buananno, who’s book “Functional Programming in C#” (ISBN:  978-1617293955) was the first that allowed me to properly understand for the first time, how some of the hard-to-grasp functional concepts worked.</p>

<p>Ian Russell, Matthew Fletcher, Liam Riley, Max Dietze, Steve “Talks Code” Collins, Gerardo Lijs, Matt Eland, Rahul Nath, Siva Gudivada, Christian Horsdal, Martin Fuß, Dave McCollough, Sebastian Robbins, David Schaefer,  Peter De Tender, Mark Seeman  who read the early drafts and provided invaluable feedback.  Thanks, folks!</p>

<p>My editor, Jill Leonard.  She must have the patience of a saint to put up with me for a whole year!</p>
