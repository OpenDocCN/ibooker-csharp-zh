- en: The animal on the cover of *C# 12 Pocket Reference* is a gray crowned crane
    (*Balearica regulorum*). This bird’s range extends from parts of Kenya and Uganda
    in the north into eastern South Africa, and they prefer to live in habitats such
    as open marshes and grasslands.

- en: Adult birds stand three to four feet tall and weigh about eight pounds. They
    are visually striking birds, with a gray body and pale-gray neck, white-and-gold
    wings, a white face (with a red patch above), a black cap, a bright-red throat
    lappet, and blue eyes. Topping all of this off (and giving them their name) is
    the distinctive spray of stiff gold filaments at the back of their heads.

- en: Crowned cranes can live for up to 20 years in the wild, spending most of their
    waking hours stalking through the grass and hunting for small animals and insects,
    as well as seeds and grains. They are one of only two types of crane to roost
    at night in trees, a feat made possible by a prehensile hind toe that allows them
    to grip branches. These birds produce clutches of up to four eggs; a few hours
    after hatching, the chicks are able to follow their parents, and the family forages
    together for food.

- en: Social and talkative, crowned cranes group together in pairs or families, which
    at times combine into flocks of more than one hundred birds. Like other cranes,
    they are well known for their elaborate mating dance, which includes elements
    such as short upward flights, wing flapping, and deep bows.

- en: Despite their wide range, these birds are currently considered endangered, threatened
    by habitat loss, egg poaching, and pesticide use. Many of the animals on O’Reilly
    covers are endangered; all of them are important to the world.
