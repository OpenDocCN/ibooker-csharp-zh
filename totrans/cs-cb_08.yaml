    checks and comparisons. Sometimes the rules are complex—naturally leading to code
    that’s difficult to write, read, and maintain. Think about how often you’ve encountered
    multibranch logic with multivariate comparisons and multiple levels of nesting.

    pattern matching—features of the language that help match facts to results with
    declarative syntax. In C#, pattern matching manifests as a growing list of features
    added in each new version, especially from C# 7 and later.

    and shows the new enhancements to the `is` operator.

- en: The `as` and `is` operators appeared in C# 1; you’re probably aware of and/or
    have used them. To recap, the `is` operator tells whether an object’s type is
    the same as the type being matched. The `as` operator performs a conversion of
    a reference type object to a specified type. The `as` operator returns `null`
    if the converted instance isn’t the specified type. This example also demonstrates
    a recent C# addition that allows both type checking and conversion with the `is`
    operator.

- en: Most of the code we write today uses generic collections and it’s increasingly
    unnecessary to use weakly typed collections. I’ll go out on a limb here and say
    that you might adopt a rule of thumb to use generic collections as a default,
    with the exception being when you can’t avoid using weakly typed collections.
    One important situation where you have to use weakly typed collections is when
    maintaining legacy code that already uses them. Generics weren’t added until C#
    2, so you might encounter some old code with weakly typed collections. Another
    example is when you have a library you need or want to use that uses weakly typed
    collections. In practical terms, you might not want to rewrite that code because
    of the time and resources required—especially if it’s already tested and working
    well.

    which is a weakly typed collection because it only operates on instances of type
    `Object`. The `ProcessLegacyCode` method calls `GetWeakTypedSchedules` and shows
    how to use the `as` and `is` operators.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first `if` statement in the `foreach` loop uses the `is` operator to determine
    whether the object is an `IRoomSchedule`. If so, it uses a cast operator to get
    an `IRoomSchedule` instance and calls `GetSchedule`. You might ask why the `is`
    operator is necessary if we already know that the collection contains `IRoomSchedule`
    instances—why don’t we just go straight for the conversion? The problem is that
    there isn’t a guarantee of what the types in that collection are. What if a developer
    accidentally loads an object that isn’t `IRoomSchedule` into the collection? The
    `is` operator improves the reliability of the code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An alternative to the `is` operator is the `as` operator. In the solution, the
    `schedule as IRoomSchedule` performs the conversion. If the result isn’t `null`,
    the object is an `IRoomSchedule`. This approach could perform better because an
    `is` operation both checks the type and still requires a conversion, whereas the
    `as` operator only requires a conversion and a `null` check.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The final `if` statement demonstrates the newer `is` operator syntax. It does
    both the type check and conversion, assigning the result to the `isRoomSchedule`
    variable. The `isRoomSchedule` variable is `null` if `schedule` wasn’t an `IRoomSchedule`,
    but since the `is` operator returned a `bool` result, we don’t need to do the
    extra `null` check.

- en: The `GetStrongTypedSchedules` and `ProcessModernCode` show how you would probably
    want to write the code today. Notice how it has less ceremony because of the strong
    typing. Each class implements the same interface, and the collection is that interface,
    allowing you to write code that operates efficiently on every object.

- en: This example also demonstrates that the new `is` operator can be useful in current
    code (not only legacy). In `ProcessModernCode`, even though all the objects implement
    `IRoomSchedule`, the `is` operator lets us check for `GoldSchedule` and do some
    extra processing.

    filter. As you know, `catch` blocks operate on the type of exception thrown. However,
    when the same exception type can be thrown for different reasons, sometimes it’s
    useful to be able to differentiate processing for each reason. While you could
    add `if` or `switch` statements in the `catch` block, filters offer a clean way
    to separate and simplify the different logic.

    This example has two `catch` blocks, each of type `ArgumentNullException`. The

    parameter to `when` is a `bool` expression. In the solution, the expression compares

    a `switch` expression. The main syntactic features of the `switch` expression
    are a shorthand notation and the ability to assign a result to a variable. If
    you think about all the times you’ve used a `switch` statement, you might have
    noticed that producing a value or new instance was a common theme. The `switch`
    expression streamlines that theme and improves upon it with pattern matching.

    the method can be command body (with arrow), returning the expression. Instead
    of a parameter in parentheses after the `switch` keyword, the parameter precedes
    the `switch` keyword. Also, instead of `case` clauses, case pattern matches precede
    an arrow, with the result expression after the arrow. The default case is the
    discard pattern, `_`.

    custom deconstructor, which we’ll use in this solution. The `GetRooms` method
    returns a `List<Room>`. `AssignRooms` uses that collection. However, because of
    the deconstructor, we can use each room as a `switch` expression parameter, which
    is smart enough to use the deconstructor to produce a tuple for pattern matching.

    is that if you’re matching scalar values, like `bool` or `int`, the property pattern
    documents better. If you’re matching strings or enums, a tuple might provide the
    best of both worlds in terms of readability and shorter syntax. Because the choice
    between the two approaches is situational, it’s best to evaluate trade-offs in
    each situation to see what makes sense to you.

    in this section, where hotel customers could have a range of points in their accounts.

    The `SilverPoints` and `GoldPoints` constants in the solution define the boundaries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `Main` method asks how many points a customer has and passes that value
    to `GetSchedule`. This value can vary, depending on how many times a person booked
    a room or used other hotel services. Because of this, `GetSchedule` uses a `switch`
    expression based on those points. Instead of using a discrete pattern for the
    match, `GetSchedule` uses relational operators.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first pattern asks if `points` is equal to or higher than `GoldPoints`.
    If not, `points` must be less, and the code checks to see if the points are equal
    to or higher than `SilverPoints`. Since we already evaluated the `GoldPoints`
    case, it follows that the range is between `SilverPoints` and less than `GoldPoints`.
    The final case, less than `SilverPoints`, documents the meaning of Bronze, but
    you could have easily replaced that with a discard pattern because the other two
    cases handled every other possibility, and Bronze is all that’s left.

    might be a better implementation. One consideration is maintenance, because breaking
    each piece of the logic out can help with debugging, whereas a single expression
    with multiple conditions might not be immediately obvious.

- en: '[Recipe 8.8](#switching_with_complex_conditions) described how to add complex
    logic to `switch` expressions. By complex, I’m referring to multiple conditions
    involving two or more properties. This contrasts with simple pattern matching
    for previous sections of this chapter that used property and tuple patterns. Somewhere
    in between these contrasting approaches of simple and complex is a moderate approach
    where you need logic isolated within individual properties.'

    the `Customer` class. Similar to earlier sections, the `Points` property contributes
    to receiving a room for a customer that has at least a certain number of points.
    The other condition, `Month`, is the month when the customer wants to book the
    room. Because of seasonal supply and demand, some months leave the hotel with
    more open rooms. Therefore, this application provides incentives, based on points,
    for customers to book rooms in the months with more open rooms.

- en: In the solution, you can see that there are `GoldPoints` and `SilverPoints`
    constants to tell which level a customer is. Also, there are constants for `May`,
    `Sep`, and `Dec`—the busy months. The logic will be to give a discount in the
    months that are not busy.

- en: 'The pattern for the `switch` expression in `GetDiscount` matches on two properties:
    `Points` and `Month`. Notice how this code doesn’t rely on an object deconstructor
    and the original parameter is a class, rather than a tuple. `GetDiscount` creates
    an inline tuple for the `switch` expression.'

- en: 'The `Month` pattern uses the new C# 9 logical operators: `and`, `not`, and
    `or`. The first expression ensures the customer receives a discount during the
    winter months, between `Sep` and `May`, except for `Dec`. The second pattern says
    that a Gold customer still gets a discount in `Dec`, except that it’s 10% instead
    of 15%.'

- en: The last pattern is logically equivalent to the first and uses DeMorgan’s Theorem.
    That is, it negates the whole result and swaps `and` with `or`. Because the last
    example applies `not` to the entire expression, it uses parentheses. In the first
    pattern, `not` applied to `Dec` only.

    `if` statements or convert the object’s type to a `string` and use a `switch`
    statement with `string` cases. A popular ask for C# over the years was to allow
    a `switch` statement with type cases, and now we finally have it.

    `BronzeCustomer`, each deriving from `Customer`. Our goal in this program is to
    schedule a room, based on the matching class type.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `GetSchedule` method does the scheduling by accepting an object of type
    `Customer`, and the `switch` expression has a pattern for each of the classes
    that derive from `Customer`. All you need to do is specify the name of each class
    and the `switch` expression matches based on the object type.
