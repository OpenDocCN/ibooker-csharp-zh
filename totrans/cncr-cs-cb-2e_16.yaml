- en: The benefits of asynchronous code have been well understood for decades before
    .NET was invented. In the early days of .NET, several different styles of asynchronous
    code were developed, used here and there, and eventually discarded. These were
    not all bad ideas; many of them paved the way for the modern `async`/`await` approach.
    However, there’s a lot of legacy code out there that uses older asynchronous patterns.
    This appendix will discuss the more common patterns, explaining how they work
    and how to integrate them with modern code.

- en: Task-Based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Task-Based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP) is the modern asynchronous API pattern
    that is ready for use with `await`. Each asynchronous operation is represented
    by a single method that returns an awaitable. An “awaitable” is any type that
    can be consumed by `await`; this is usually `Task` or `Task<T>` but may also be
    `ValueTask`, `ValueTask<T>`, a type defined by a framework (e.g., `IAsyncAction`
    or `IAsyncOperation<T>`, used by Universal Windows applications), or even a custom
    type defined by a library.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is common for TAP methods to have an `Async` suffix. However, this is just
    a convention; not all TAP methods have an `Async` suffix. It can be skipped if
    the API developer believes the asynchronous context is sufficiently implied; e.g.,
    `Task.WhenAll` and `Task.WhenAny` do not have an `Async` suffix. Furthermore,
    keep in mind that the `Async` suffix may be present on *non*-TAP methods (e.g.,
    `WebClient.DownloadStringAsync` is not a TAP method). The usual pattern in this
    case is for the TAP method to have a `TaskAsync` suffix (e.g., `WebClient.DownloadStringTaskAsync`
    is a TAP method).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Methods that return asynchronous streams also follow a TAP-like pattern, with
    `Async` used as a suffix. Even though they don’t return awaitables, they do return
    awaitable streams—types that can be consumed using `await foreach`.

- en: Asynchronous Programming Model (APM)
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After TAP, the Asynchronous Programming Model (APM) pattern is probably the
    next most-common pattern you’ll encounter. It was the first pattern where asynchronous
    operations had first-class object representations. The telltale sign of this pattern
    is the `IAsyncResult` objects in conjunction with a pair of methods that manage
    the operation, one starting with `Begin` and the other starting with `End`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`IAsyncResult` was strongly influenced by [native overlapped I/O](http://bit.ly/sync-ipop).
    The APM pattern allows consuming code to behave either synchronously or asynchronously.
    The consuming code can choose from these options:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Block for the operation to complete. This is done by calling the `End` method.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Supply a callback delegate to invoke when the operation completes.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In all cases, the consuming code must eventually call the `End` method to retrieve
    the results of the asynchronous operation. If the operation is not completed when
    `End` is called, it’ll block the calling thread until the operation completes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `Begin` method takes an `AsyncCallback` parameter and an `object` parameter
    (usually called `state`) as its last two parameters. These are used by consuming
    code to provide a callback delegate to invoke when the operation completes. The
    `object` parameter can be whatever you want; this is a holdover from the very
    early days of .NET, before lambda methods or even anonymous methods existed. It
    is just used to provide context to the `AsyncCallback` parameter.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The APM is fairly widespread among Microsoft libraries, but is not as common
    in the wider .NET ecosystem. This is because there were never any `IAsyncResult`
    implementations made available for reuse, and implementing that interface correctly
    is fairly complex. In addition, it is difficult to compose APM-based systems.
    I’ve seen only a few custom `IAsyncResult` implementations in the wild; all of
    these were some version of Jeffrey Richter’s general-purpose `IAsyncResult` implementation,
    as published in his article, “Concurrent Affairs: Implementing the CLR Asynchronous
    Programming Model,” from [the March 2007 edition of *MSDN Magazine*](http://bit.ly/conc-aff).'

- en: There are some cases in which code *almost* follows the APM pattern, but not
    quite; e.g.,, the old `Microsoft.TeamFoundation` client libraries did not include
    the `object` parameter in their `Begin` methods. In these cases, `Task.Factory.FromAsync`
    will not work, and you then have the choice of two options. The less efficient
    option is to call the `Begin` method and pass the `IAsyncResult` to `FromAsync`.
    The less elegant option is to use the more flexible `TaskCompletionSource<T>`;

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Event-Based Asynchronous Programming (EAP) defines a matching method/event
    pair. The method usually ends in `Async`, and it eventually causes an event to
    be raised that ends in `Completed`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a few caveats when working with EAP that make it a bit more difficult
    than it first appears. First, you have to remember to add your handler to the
    event *before* calling the method; otherwise, you’d have a race condition where
    the event could happen before you subscribed, and then you’d never see it complete.
    Second, components written in the EAP pattern usually capture the current `SynchronizationContext`
    at some point and then raise their event in that context. Some components capture
    the `SynchronizationContext` in the constructor, and others capture it at the
    time the method is called and the asynchronous operation begins.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a pattern that is much more common in other languages, particularly
    JavaScript and TypeScript as used by Node.js developers. In this pattern, each
    asynchronous operation takes a callback delegate that is invoked when the operation
    completes, either successfully or with error. A variant of this pattern uses *two*
    callback delegates, one for success and one for error. This kind of callback is
    called a “continuation,” and the continuation is passed as a parameter, hence
    the name “continuation passing style.” This pattern was never common in the .NET
    world, but there are a few older open source libraries that used it.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Very specialized types will sometimes define their own custom asynchronous patterns.
    The most famous example of this is the `Socket` type, which defined a pattern
    that passed around `SocketAsyncEventArgs` instances representing the operation.
    The reason this pattern was introduced was that `SocketAsyncEventArgs` could be
    reused, thus reducing memory churn for applications that do heavy network activity.
    Modern applications can use [`ValueTask<T>` with `ManualResetValueTaskSourceCore<T>`](http://bit.ly/man-reset-type-doc)

    the `FileSystemWatcher` type. To observe file system changes, the consuming code
    first subscribes to multiple events and then sets the `EnableRaisingEvents` property

    used to schedule work to a UI thread so that the component’s events are raised
