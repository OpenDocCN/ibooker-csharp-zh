<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>If you had to pick two popular technologies to focus on that emerged over the last 20 years, it would be tough to pick two better choices than C# and AWS.  Anders Hejlsberg designed C# for Microsoft in 2000, and a few years later, the .NET Framework and Visual Studio launched.  Next, in  2004, Mono, a cross-platform compiler and runtime for C#, became widely available.  This ecosystem has enabled unique platforms and technologies, including the cross-platform mobile framework Xamarin.</p>
<p>In an alternate universe in the early 2000s, Amazon switched to a service-oriented architecture that culminated in a 2002 release of public web services.  As the services grew in popularity, Amazon released SQS in 2004 and Amazon S3 and EC2 in 2006.  These storage, compute, and messaging services are still the core building blocks of Amazon Web Services (AWS).  As of 2022, AWS has at least 27 geographic regions, 87 availability zones, millions of servers, and hundreds of services.  These services include various offerings ranging from machine learning (SageMaker) to serverless (Lambda). This book shows what is possible with these two remarkable technology stacks. You’ll learn the theory surrounding cloud computing and how to implement it using AWS.  You will also build many solutions with AWS technology, from serverless to DevOps implemented with the power of the .NET ecosystem, culminating in many elegant solutions that use these two powerful technologies.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Who Should Read This Book" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45599668087104">
<h1>Who Should Read This Book</h1>
<p>This book is for C# developers looking to explore the possibilities on AWS. The book could also be considered an introduction to AWS and cloud computing in general. We will introduce many cloud computing topics from a standing start, so if this is your first foray into cloud-based software development, then rest assured we will provide all the context you will need.</p>
<p>While C# is <em>technically</em> just a programming language and not a framework, we will be relating almost exclusively to .NET application developers building web applications. There will be passing references to Blazor and Xamarin but knowledge of these is absolutely not required. We also have content relevant to developers familiar with both the older .NET Framework, and to the newer .NET (previously <em>.NET Core</em>).</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="How This Book Is Organized" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45599668529760">
<h1>How This Book Is Organized</h1>
<p>AWS offers over 200 services to build all kinds of cloud-based applications, and we have organised this book to cover the services we feel are most important to a C# developer. The chapters are structured as follows.</p>
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch01.xhtml#Chapter1">Chapter 1, “Getting Started with .NET on AWS”</a>, serves as an introduction to AWS and how to interact with and configure your services.</p>
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch02.xhtml#Chapter2">Chapter 2, “AWS Core Services”</a>, covers Storage and Compute in detail, two of the most widely used services that will also feel most familiar to a .NET application developer used to deploying to web servers.</p>
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch03.xhtml#Chapter3">Chapter 3, “Migrating a Legacy .NET Framework Application to AWS”</a>, serves as a brief overview of the many ways you can rapidly migrate an existing codebase to AWS, either from an existing physical or virtual machine, or another cloud provider.</p>
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch04.xhtml#Chapter4">Chapter 4, “Modernizing .NET Applications 
<span class="keep-together">to Serverless</span>”</a>, takes you one step further than migrating existing applications and looks at ways you can modernize the way your code is architected to follow a serverless model, with examples on AWS.</p>
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch05.xhtml#Chapter5">Chapter 5, “Containerization of .NET”</a>, is all about containers. If you are already using Docker containers for your .NET web application, this chapter will help you rapidly deploy these to a managed container service on AWS.</p>
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch06.xhtml#Chapter6">Chapter 6, “DevOps”</a>, did you know AWS has a fully managed continuous delivery service called CodePipeline? This chapter shows you how you can simplify your application’s path to production using the tools provided on AWS.</p>
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch07.xhtml#Chapter7">Chapter 7, “Logging, Monitoring, and 
<span class="keep-together">Instrumentation for .NET</span>”</a>, Monitoring and Instrumentation for .NET continues on from DevOps to demonstrate some of the logging and monitoring functionality you can integrate into your applications. We will also look at manually pushing performance metrics directly from your C# code.</p>
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch08.xhtml#Chapter8">Chapter 8, “Developing with AWS C# SDK”</a>, is the final chapter of this book and offers a more in depth look at the SDK tools for C# that allow you to integrate AWS services into your code.</p>
<p>Finally, there are two appendixes that you might find helpful at the back of the book that didn’t fit in cleanly in any chapter. <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="app01.xhtml#appendix-benchmark-aws">Appendix A, “Benchmarking AWS”</a>, walks through how to benchmark AWS machines and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="app02.xhtml#appendix-csharp-tutorial">Appendix B, “Getting Started with .NET”</a>, shows a brief C# and F# GitHub Codespaces tutorial.</p>
<p>Additionally, each chapter includes critical thinking questions and exercises. Critical thinking questions are a great starting point for team discussions, user groups, or preparation for a job interview or certification. The exercises help you learn by doing and applying the context of the chapter into a working code example. These examples could make excellent portfolio pieces.</p>

<h2>Noah</h2>
<p>It is always an honor to have the opportunity to work on an O’Reilly book.  This book marks my fourth for O’Reilly, and I am working on the fifth book on Enterprise MLOps.  Thank you to <a href="https://oreil.ly/GbCM4">Rachel Roumeliotis</a> for allowing me to work on this book and <a href="https://oreil.ly/TyZX7">Zan McQuade</a> for the excellent strategic direction.</p>
<p>Both my coauthor <a href="https://oreil.ly/ReRkb">James Charlesworth</a> and our development editor <a href="https://oreil.ly/Sm2Nn">Melissa Potter</a> are fantastic to work with, and I am lucky to work with two such talented people on a project this demanding.  Thanks to Lior Kirshner-Shalom
and from AWS, <a href="https://oreil.ly/75Nab">Nivas Durairaj</a>, David Pallmann, and Bryan Hogan, who provided many insightful comments and corrections during technical reviews.</p>
<p>Thanks as well to many of my current and former students as well as faculty and staff at <a href="https://oreil.ly/2SWqF">Duke MIDS</a>, <a href="https://oreil.ly/bTcbr">Duke Artificial Intelligence Masters in Engineering</a>, <a href="https://oreil.ly/ZB0SH">UC Davis MSBA</a>, <a href="https://oreil.ly/cX4XH">UC Berkeley</a>, <a href="https://oreil.ly/i9AIB">Northwestern MS in Data Science Program</a> as well as <a href="https://oreil.ly/u3rJi">UTK</a> and <a href="https://oreil.ly/yCydZ">UNC Charlotte</a>.</p>
<p>These people include in no particular order: <a href="https://oreil.ly/gMxsP">Dickson Louie</a>, <a href="https://oreil.ly/IEnYf">Andrew B. Hargadon</a>, <a href="https://oreil.ly/Mgkru">Hemant Bhargava</a>, <a href="https://oreil.ly/ABcjv">Amy Russell</a>, <a href="https://oreil.ly/fqVSg">Ashwin Aravindakshan</a>, <a href="https://oreil.ly/8aoUi">Ken Gilbert</a>, <a href="https://oreil.ly/PouWU">Michel Ballings</a>, <a href="https://oreil.ly/IsCsh">Jon Reifschneider</a>, <a href="https://oreil.ly/iQ0yY">Robert Calderbank</a>, and <a href="https://oreil.ly/HvsSl">Alfredo Deza</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, thank you to my family, Leah, Liam, and Theodore, who put up with me working on weekends and late at night to hit deadlines.</p>

<section class="pagebreak-before less_space" data-pdf-bookmark="James" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="idm45599668610400">
<h2>James</h2>
<p>This is my first book with O’Reilly, and I have been overwhelmed by the support we have received from the team, especially Melissa Potter, without whom you would have suffered a lot more of my convoluted British spellings. I’d also echo Noah’s thanks to the technical reviewers, specifically David Pallmann and Bryan Hogan at AWS.</p>
<p>The tech industry moves at such a rapid pace that you do not get anywhere without standing on the shoulders of giants. It is for this reason that I’d like to thank two of my former bosses, <a href="https://oreil.ly/0ZmWS">James Woodley</a> and <a href="https://oreil.ly/dlL6x">Dave Rensin</a>, for all the advice, coaching, mentorship, and support over recent years.</p>
<p>Lastly, big shout out to my amazing wife, Kaja, who supports me through all my endeavors, I will always be your Richard Castle.</p>
