    world) that is actually one of a set of different types. Which type an instance
    of a DU actually is at any given moment has to be checked before use.

    Despite sharing a common runtime with C#, and the feature being there for us *in
    theory*, there are only plans in place to introduce them into C# at some point
    - but it’s not certain how or when. What we can do in the meantime is roughly
    simulate them with abstract classes, and that’s the technique I’m going to talk
    about in this chapter.

    a single-line fix to remove a little bit of boilerplate. DUs are closer in concept
    to a design pattern - in that they have a structure, and some logic that needs
    to be implemented around it.

    and “Attraction”, as well as “DateOfTrip and “StartDate” here, to avoid duplication,
    but it means that we’ve lost some of the terminology that makes code dealing with
    day trips meaningful.

    50-50 chance of decaying, which would kill the cat. The point was that, according

    box to check on the cat, both states - alive and dead - exist at the same time.

    of returning from a function where there’s some uncertainty as to how it might
    behave. What about scenarios where you might want to return two or more entirely
    different types?

    types. I’m not entirely sure what you’d call each of them, but it’s certainly
    possible. There’s just a lot of awkward boilerplate, in that you have to include
    all of the references to the generic types in a lot of places. At least it works,
    though…​

    they are used, and just how incredibly powerful they are as a code feature.

- en: Discriminated Unions can be used to massively cut down on boilerplate code,
    and make use of a datatype that descriptively represents all possible states of
    the system, in a way that strongly encourages the receiving function to handle
    them appropriately.

    functional languages, but there are possibilities in C#, at least.

    that despite being called “discriminated unions” they bear no connection to anyone’s
    view of love and/or marriage or to worker’s organizations.
