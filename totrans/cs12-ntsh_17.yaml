- en: An *assembly* is the basic unit of deployment in .NET and is also the container
    for all types. An assembly contains compiled types with their Intermediate Language
    (IL) code, runtime resources, and information to assist with versioning and referencing
    other assemblies. An assembly also defines a boundary for type resolution. In
    .NET, an assembly comprises a single file with a *.dll* extension.

- en: Signing with Authenticode requires that you contact a *Certificate Authority*
    (CA) with evidence of your personal identity or company’s identity (articles of
    incorporation, etc.). After the CA has checked your documents, it will issue an
    X.509 code-signing certificate that is typically valid for one to five years.
    This enables you to sign assemblies with the *signtool* utility. You can also
    make a certificate yourself with the *makecert* utility; however, it will be recognized
    only on computers on which the certificate is explicitly installed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fact that (non-self-signed) certificates can work on any computer relies
    on public key infrastructure. Essentially, your certificate is signed with another
    certificate belonging to a CA. The CA is trusted because all CAs are loaded into
    the OS. (To see them, go to the Windows Control Panel and then, in the search
    box, type `**certificate**`. In the Administrative Tools section, click “Manage
    computer certificates.” This launches the Certificate Manager. Open the node Trusted
    Root Certification Authorities and click Certificates.) A CA can revoke a publisher’s
    certificate if leaked, so verifying an Authenticode signature requires periodically
    asking the CA for an up-to-date list of certification revocations.
