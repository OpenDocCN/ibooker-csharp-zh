- en: One way to get a more profound knowledge of AWS is to benchmark the performance
    of different machines. Part of the value of AWS is the ability to use many various
    services and other abstractions to solve problems in the most efficient manner
    possible. You can view many code examples in this [example GitHub Repository on
    benchmarking](https://github.com/noahgift/benchmarking-aws). Notice that there
    are substantial differences in sysbench benchmarks from 1 core to a 36 core to
    a 96 core machine as shown in [Figure A-1](#Figure-1-8).

    Core on Linux, it would be a great idea to do some initial benchmarking. To run
    these benchmarks in a repeatable manner on Amazon Linux 2, you can refer to this
    [`Makefile`](https://oreil.ly/IF5rR). Notice how `sysbench` only needs two lines
    to install and run the `./benchmark.sh` script.

    OS. It is always good to perform multiple measures, including an OS-level benchmark
    and application load test, on the actual environment in which an application gets
    deployed.
