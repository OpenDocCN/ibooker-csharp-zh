<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>C# has now existed for around two decades. It has grown steadily in both power and size, but Microsoft has always kept the essential characteristics intact. Each new capability is designed to integrate cleanly with the rest, enhancing the language without turning it into an incoherent bag of miscellaneous features.</p>
<p>Even though C# continues to be a fairly straightforward language at its heart, there is a great deal more to say about it now than in its first incarnation. Because there is so much ground to cover, this book expects a certain level of technical ability from its readers.</p>

<h1>Who This Book Is For</h1>
<p>I have written this book for experienced developers—I’ve been programming for years, and I set out to make this the book I would want to read if that experience had been in other languages, and I were learning C# today. Whereas earlier editions explained some basic concepts such as classes, polymorphism, and collections, I am assuming that readers will already know what these are. The early chapters still describe how C# presents these common ideas, but the focus is on the details specific to C#, rather than the broad concepts.</p>
