- en: C# 12 represents the ninth major update to Microsoft’s flagship programming
    language, positioning C# as a language with unusual flexibility and breadth. At
    one end, it offers high-level abstractions such as query expressions and asynchronous
    continuations, whereas at the other end, it allows low-level efficiency through
    constructs such as custom value types and optional pointers.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The price of this growth is that there’s more than ever to learn. Although tools
    such as Microsoft’s IntelliSense—and online references—are excellent in helping
    you on the job, they presume an existing map of conceptual knowledge. This book
    provides exactly that map of knowledge in a concise and unified style—free of
    clutter and long introductions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like the past seven editions, *C# 12 in a Nutshell* is organized around concepts
    and use cases, making it friendly both to sequential reading and to random browsing.
    It also plumbs significant depths while assuming only basic background knowledge,
    making it accessible to intermediate as well as advanced readers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book covers C#, the Common Language Runtime (CLR), and the .NET 8 Base
    Class Library (BCL). We’ve chosen this focus to allow space for difficult and
    advanced topics without compromising depth or readability. Features recently added
    to C# are flagged so that you can also use this book as a reference for C# 11
    and C# 10.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book targets intermediate to advanced audiences. No prior knowledge of
    C# is required, but some general programming experience is necessary. For the
    beginner, this book complements, rather than replaces, a tutorial-style introduction
    to programming.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is an ideal companion to any of the vast array of books that focus
    on an applied technology such as ASP.NET Core or Windows Presentation Foundation
    (WPF). *C# 12 in a Nutshell* covers the areas of the language and .NET that such
    books omit, and vice versa.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re looking for a book that skims every .NET technology, this is not for
    you. This book is also unsuitable if you want to learn about APIs specific to
    mobile device development.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html#chash_language_basics) through [Chapter 4](ch04.html#advanced_chash)
    concentrate purely on C#, starting with the basics of syntax, types, and variables,
    and finishing with advanced topics such as unsafe code and preprocessor directives.
    If you’re new to the language, you should read these chapters sequentially.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The remaining chapters focus on .NET 8’s Base Class Libraries, covering such
    topics as Language-Integrated Query (LINQ), XML, collections, concurrency, I/O
    and networking, memory management, reflection, dynamic programming, attributes,
    cryptography, and native interoperability. You can read most of these chapters
    randomly, except for Chapters [5](ch05.html#dotnet_overview) and [6](ch06.html#dotnet_fundamentals),
    which lay a foundation for subsequent topics. You’re also best off reading the
    three chapters on LINQ in sequence, and some chapters assume some knowledge of
    concurrency, which we cover in [Chapter 14](ch14.html#concurrency_and_asynchron).

- en: The examples in this book require .NET 8\. You will also find Microsoft’s .NET
    documentation useful to look up individual types and members (which is available
    [online](https://oreil.ly/y5bAc)).

    your program from the command line, you’ll be much more productive with a *code
    scratchpad* for instantly testing code snippets, plus an *integrated development
    environment* (IDE) for producing executables and libraries.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book uses basic UML notation to illustrate relationships between types,
    as shown in [Figure P-1](#sample_diagram). A slanted rectangle means an abstract
    class; a circle means an interface. A line with a hollow triangle denotes inheritance,
    with the triangle pointing to the base type. A line with an arrow denotes a one-way
    association; a line without an arrow denotes a two-way association.
