<h1>Summary</h1>


<p>In many ways, this book has been a reflection of my own career. In one form or another, each recipe represents solutions to problems that I and others have encountered over the years. However, it’s more than that because the thought process that goes into each recipe, chapter, and the entire book has been illuminating. The way we write code today has changed a lot. So have the types of applications we write.</p>

<p>C# was born in an era of the internet coming of age, when the .com bust of the early 2000s was barely conceivable. The impetus behind its creation was the legal battles between Microsoft and Sun Microsystems over the Java programming language. Microsoft needed a component-based programming language for its new .NET platform. It was the early days of distributed computing, and visions of proprietary remoting technology and XML Web services have come and gone. Today is a different world.</p>

<p>In the intervening years, we’ve seen revolutions that changed the entire face of computing. Mobile phones evolved into smart phones with more computing power than the original IBM PC. Applications and entire businesses moved from hosted services to the cloud. Client/server and nascent distributed computing models became massive world-scale native cloud applications using microservice architectures and serverless computing. The types of applications we build are different.</p>

<p>So, as the computing world has evolved, the programming languages and tools we use must embrace that change. That was the goal with this book, and I hope it helps you. I’m honored to have shared this journey with you and wish you the best in your C# development career.</p>
