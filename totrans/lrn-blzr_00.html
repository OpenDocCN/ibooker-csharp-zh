<h1>Foreword</h1>


<p>Web development has been a dominating feature of the software industry for over 20 years and is likely to remain so for many years to come. Industry giants continue to invest heavily in expanding web technology’s power and flexibility, enabling an increasing range of advanced browser-based software. While native mobile apps and augmented reality / virtual reality apps find their place for consumer software, the web is overwhelmingly the default UI for business apps. If you could bet on only one application platform, you should bet on the web.</p>

<p>During those same 20 years, .NET (first released in 2002) has held its place as Microsoft’s premiere developer toolset. Like the web, .NET continues to gain strength. It was reinvented as cloud-first, cross-platform, and fully open source in 2016 and today is used by about 30% of all professional software developers.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="foreword01.html#idm46365048795776" id="idm46365048795776-marker">1</a></sup> C# has always been considered one of the most productive languages, at the forefront of rich developer tooling with precise code completions and a top debugging experience, and now ASP.NET Core is one of the fastest server-side web technologies.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="foreword01.html#idm46365047437744" id="idm46365047437744-marker">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The goal of Blazor is to unlock the full power of .NET for browser-based UI applications. It’s the .NET team’s best effort to create the most productive and natural way to create single-page application–type apps. This includes Blazor’s component-based programming model, which takes the best aspects of many modern UI frameworks and unifies them into something natural for .NET with its strong typing. Beyond that, it means connecting with the rest of the .NET ecosystem, with its industry-leading IDEs and first-class features for debugging, testing, and hot reload. Blazor’s biggest innovation might be its flexible execution models, running server-side with UI streaming to browsers over a websocket, directly inside the browser on WebAssembly, or as native code in mobile and desktop apps.</p>

<p><em>Learning Blazor</em> provides both a deep and broad look at Blazor app development. Unlike many other books, it doesn’t just focus on the easy parts of C# programming and leave real-world complexity as an exercise for the reader. Instead, David sets out the whole range of web development concerns—including authentication, security, performance, localization, and deployment (CI/CD)—right in front of you, starting from the beginning. With some focus, you’ll be able to absorb David’s broad expertise and be equipped to take on realistic work of your own.</p>

<p>David is well placed to explain not just how things work today but also how they’ve evolved to their present state and even how things may change in the future. He’s been a well-known figure in the Blazor community for years, is well connected with engineering leaders within Microsoft, and has an even longer history as a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) and a Google Developer Expert (GDE) in web technologies. Throughout this book, you’ll find many historical details and anecdotes that shed light on the challenges, decisions, and people who shaped web development and .NET into the technology you’ll be using. David’s enthusiasm will propel you through a complex landscape.</p>

<p>My biggest motivation when creating the first release of Blazor with Dan Roth and Ryan Nowak was to help free web UI from its monoculture. I appreciate JavaScript and have built a lot of my career on it, but there are so many other programming languages, paradigms, and communities that could bring their own richness into the browser. I know you’ll find your own ways to innovate with the software you create and for the users who benefit. I wish you all the best with your Blazor projects and am confident you’ll find inspiration in these pages.</p>
